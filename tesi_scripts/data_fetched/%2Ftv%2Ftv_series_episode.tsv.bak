The series' creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months prior to its airing on May 6. Before writing the episode, David Crane, Marta Kauffman and Kevin S. Bright decided to watch the series finales of other sitcoms, paying attention to what worked and what did not. Kauffman found that they liked the ones which stayed true to the series, and they found the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show to be the gold standard. The writers had difficulty writing the finale, and spent several days thinking about the finale scene without being able to write a word. Crane said that they did not want to do "something high concept, or take the show out of the show".

Matthews's co-star in Dracula: Prince of Darkness had been Charles Tingwell, who was chosen to voice Dr. Fawn, the Cloudbase chief medical officer. Tingwell, who had provided voices for the second season of Thunderbirds and its first feature film, Thunderbirds Are Go, had initially been recommended to the Andersons by Ray Barrett, a fellow Australian actor who had worked on Stingray and Thunderbirds. However, due to theatre commitments, Tingwell could only contribute to the first 12 produced episodes of Captain Scarlet. Also departing after the completion of "Shadow of Fear" was the voice of Captain Grey, Paul Maxwell, a Canadian actor who had voiced the character of Steve Zodiac three years earlier in Fireball XL5.

In "Shadow of Fear" an SPV is stationed outside the K14 Observatory. It does not see any action. When the observatory is blown up the ensuing avalanche purportedly takes the SPV with it. Due to the Himalayan terrain, the SPV's role as an active field vehicle is taken up by aerial vehicles like the Spectrum Helicopter, the Angels, and even Cloudbase itself. Note that the SPV was perfectly functional in Avalanche, which used the same backdrop.

The series, then, intended to satirise politics and government in general, rather than any specific party. The writers placed Hacker at the centre of the political spectrum, and were careful to identify his party headquarters as "Central House" (a combination of Conservative Central Office and Labour's Transport House). The terms "Labour" and "Conservative" are scrupulously avoided throughout the series, favouring terms such as "the party" or "the Government" and "the opposition". In the first scene of the first episode, "Open Government", Hacker is shown at the declaration of his constituency result wearing a white rosette, with other candidates sporting the red and blue rosettes associated with the two leading British parties. The one exception to this neutrality occurs very briefly in "The National Education Service", when Sir Humphrey explains to Bernard how the policy of comprehensive education is retained through successive governments, using different arguments according to which party is in power. Even there, Humphrey does not reveal which party Jim Hacker represents. Despite this, the overall thrust was towards government reduction rather than expansion. The episode "Jobs for the Boys", for example, rejected corporatism. Throughout the period of Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister the incumbent government of the United Kingdom was Conservative with the government led by Thatcher.

Hacker's political party is never explicitly stated, which was a deliberate ploy by the series' creators to prevent the show from having a partisan affiliation. In the opening scene of the pilot episode the victorious Hacker's party rosette is white, as opposed to the red and blue ones worn by the other candidates. In The National Education Service, however, Sir Humphrey tells Bernard, "When there is a Labour government, the education authorities tell them that comprehensives abolish the class system and when there's a Tory government we tell them that it's the cheapest way of providing mass education; to Labour we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive." He then goes on to tell Hacker neither of these things, implying that Hacker is from neither party. Throughout the show, Hacker's political opinions tend towards reform of administration and are neither left nor right wing. The writers have established that they privately saw Hacker as a centrist 'compassionate' Conservative.

Bullwinkle shared a house with his best friend Rocky in the fictional small town of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, a parody of the real-life American town of International Falls, Minnesota. Bullwinkle attended college at "Wossamotta U" on a football scholarship. He is a long-time supporter of the Bull Moose Party, and at one time was the part-owner, part-governor of the island of Moosylvania. In seasons 1 and 2, he makes reference to having an Uncle Dewlap, who bequeathed Bullwinkle vast amounts of wealth (in the form of a cereal boxtop collection, and an Upsidaisium mine).

The crew in Star Trek: Voyager use the same uniforms seen in the early episodes of Deep Space Nine throughout the show's run. Stuck in the Delta Quadrant and out of contact with Starfleet, unlike the DS9 crew, the Voyager crew never makes the switch to the updated uniform seen in later DS9 episodes and the rest of the TNG films, although in the episode ""Message in a bottle"" in season 4 of the series the EMH mark II is wearing the updated "DS9" uniform. Starfleet personnel back in the Alpha Quadrant are seen wearing this uniform in later seasons of the show as well, when Voyager manages to reestablish contact with home.

When Captain Scarlet pursues a renegade Air Conditioning Maintenance Truck under Mysteron controllers intent on destroying key links in the Frost Line Outer Space Missile Defense System in the episode "Avalanche", the SPV takes a battering after Liquid Oxygen renders the snowy, icy road too slippery to be safe, causing the SPV to crash in the mountains. Captain Scarlet had no external injuries in the crash. This particular SPV requisitioned by Captain Scarlet and Lieutenant Green was stored in a log cabin under the attendance of a Canadian, French-speaking logger and was driven off-road in the snow in a bid to lose some of the distance between it and the truck.

Water rotation in home bathrooms under normal circumstances is not related to the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the earth, and no consistent difference in rotation direction between toilets in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed. The formation of a vortex over the plug hole may be explained by the conservation of angular momentum: The radius of rotation decreases as water approaches the plug hole, so the rate of rotation increases, for the same reason that an ice skater's rate of spin increases as they pull their arms in. Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward. Only if the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may determine the direction of the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect may be much smaller than various other influences on drain direction such as any residual rotation of the water and the geometry of the container. Despite this, the idea that toilets and bathtubs drain differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres has been popularized by several television programs, including Wedding Crashers, The Simpsons episode "Bart vs. Australia," and The X-Files episode "Die Hand Die Verletzt". Several science broadcasts and publications, including at least one college-level physics textbook, have also stated this.

The DVD Journal gave the season four out of four stars, calling it a "memorable season". The review highlighted "The Host", "Duane Barry" and "Ascension", the cliffhanger finale "Anasazi", the "unforgettable" "Humbug", and meeting Mulder and Scully's families in "Colony" and "One Breath". IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had "started to explore a little" and the "evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated several episodes across the season highly, awarding five stars out of five to "Little Green Men", "Duane Barry", "One Breath", "Irresistible", "Die Hand Die Verletzt", and "Anasazi". However, several episodes rated poorly, with "3", "Excelsis Dei", and "The Calusari" being considered particularly poor.

In 1977, Gold joined The Muppet Show during the show's second season and was quickly trained by Jim Henson as a puppeteer, becoming the only British puppeteer regularly employed on the show. She played several characters during her four seasons with the show, the best-known of which was Annie Sue Pig. She also sang on several of The Muppets' albums and was often paired vocally with Jerry Nelson. She was a puppeteer in the films The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and The Dark Crystal (1982), and she appeared in various other Muppet series and specials. Muppet chronicler Christopher Finch wrote that Gold was "the most versatile female puppeteer to work on The Muppet Show  the only British member of the cast." During these years, she continued to appear in musicals and plays in between her commitments to The Muppets. Among her non-puppeteering television appearances, Gold was featured as Mrs Tyler, a Goodwife, in the first series episode "Witchsmeller Pursuivant" of Blackadder (1983). The same year, she appeared as Maureen Bedford in episode two of For 4 Tonight, a talk-show spoof. In 1991, she played the domineering Private Elsa Bigstern in two episodes of 'Allo! 'Allo!

Reviews of the episode by television critics were mostly positive. Critic Ahsan Haque of IGN placed "Road to Europe" in the top ten of Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures, ranking it fifth. Haque noted that the episode is not as entertaining as many of the other Stewie and Brian adventures, but the song included in the episode, "You and I Are So Awfully Different" made it worthy of an appearance on the list. "Road to Europe" is the lowest ranked Road to ... episode on the list with "Road to Germany" at number four, "Road to Rupert" at number three, "Road to the Multiverse" at number two and "Road to Rhode Island" ranked as the best. Television critic Ramsey Isler, also of IGN, commented positively about the episode in his review of the eighth season episode "Go Stewie, Go", which contained an American version of "Jolly Farm Revue". Isler went on to note, "for the most part the Jolly Farm concept is much less interesting than it was in the much more amusing and classic Family Guy episode, "Road to Europe"."

The toy has also made various pop culture appearances. The songwriter and visual artist Daniel Johnston has featured the Farmer Says See 'N Say on several recordings, most notably the song "Walking the Cow" from his 1983 album entitled Hi, How Are You. The 1989 version of The Farmer Says See 'n Say is featured in the animated film Toy Story (1995). A more recent version of The Farmer Says See 'n Say appears in the film Over the Hedge (2006). On the Family Guy episode "Petarded", Peter Griffin uses a See 'n Say instead of a calculator on a mental test. Also, in the Family Guy episode Road to Germany, Stewie Griffin plays with a European See 'n Say, but the animals make strange sounds (ex.: the cow says "Shazoo!" instead of "Moooo!").

For the initial release of the VHS editions, episodes of Red Dwarf were separated and two tapes were released for each series (except series VII, which was released on three separate tapes), labelled 'byte one' and 'byte two'. These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos. For series V, "Back to Reality" and "Quarantine" were given top billing on their respective video release. For the second VHS volume of series I, "Confidence and Paranoia" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being "Waiting for God" which shared its name with the title of another comedy series (set in a retirement home). Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context. All eight series were made available on VHS, and three episodes of series VII were also released as special "Xtended"  versions with extra scenes (including an original, unbroadcast ending for the episode "Tikka To Ride") and no laugh track; the remastered versions of series I–III were also released individually and in a complete box-set. Finally, two outtake videos were released, Smeg Ups in 1994, and its sequel Smeg Outs in 1995.

As the episode was originally intended as the series finale, it includes references to earlier episodes. For example, in the ending wedding scene, a montage of many 'one-time' and other minor characters from previous episodes at the wedding, including the social worker from the first episode and "Junkie Business", Monsignor Martinez, Hank's half-brother Junichiro, Patch Boomhauer, Tammy Duvall, Mack Walker, Gary Kasner, Ms. Wakefield, Ernst, Peggy's mother (A Rover Runs Through It version) and Dale's father Bug Gribble is seen. Also, Cotton Hill tells Kahn that he'll have a mai tai at the wedding much like he did in his first appearance in the episode Shins of the Father. Chuck Mangione appears at the end of the wedding scene. Once an often recurring character in early seasons, he has rarely appeared in more recent episodes. However, his running gag is maintained when the wedding song he plays for Luanne and Lucky turns, as does everything else he plays, into "Feels So Good".

Of all the powers Sylar has acquired, the most prominently used is telekinesis, which is the first power he took. In contrast to the limited abilities Brian Davis displayed, Sylar's skills are far more advanced; he exhibits both fine control (precisely cutting open the skulls of his victims) and sheer force (flipping a police van), can enhance his own strength and durability to superhuman levels, and can control a person's motor skills in a manner similar to Eric Doyle's puppet mastery. Tests done on Sylar by Bennet's associate Hank show no overt signs of powers other than telekinesis; while their tests show that he possesses other powers, they are unable to identify what they are.

Sam Loover, a secret agent for the World Intelligence Network (WIN), persuades Mac, his friend, to dedicate the BIG RAT to WIN's pursuit of world peace by permitting Joe to assume such knowledge and experience and become an operative for the organisation. After the requisite skill is transferred, and provided that Joe is wearing special glasses containing hidden electrodes storing the expertise, he is able to execute such missions as operating fighter aircraft, blasting off into space and performing advanced neurosurgery, all the while appearing to be an innocent schoolboy to the enemies of WIN. Since no one would suspect a child of espionage, Joe quickly becomes WIN's "Most Special Agent". Reporting to the commander-in-chief of WIN's London Headquarters, Shane Weston, he is also provided with a special briefcase, which on superficial inspection appears to be a simple school case but in fact conceals an adapted handgun and transceiver. There is some inconsistency as to why Joe assumes the codename "90". Promotional information states that, in the pilot, Joe joins 89 other WIN agents based in London, becoming the 90th agent. However, in the episode "Project 90", the BIG RAT is referred to as WIN's "File 90" and (according to dialogue from Professor McClaine) Joe's designation originates from this.

The more violent style introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is occasionally evident in Joe 90. In the episode "Hi-jacked", for instance, Joe kills an enemy with a grenade. Meanwhile, in "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill that threatens to pulverise his head.

Also revealed in "My Own Worst Enemy", he has feelings for a squeaky-voiced intern named Josephine. He is seen again in "My Finale" during J.D.'s fantasy about everyone he met at the hospital with his arm around Josephine, and returns once more in "Our Drunk Friend" in a brief cameo.

Ronald aka Snoop Dogg Attending (formerly Snoop Dogg Resident and Snoop Dogg Intern), played by Manley Henry, is nicknamed as such because of his physical resemblance to Snoop Dogg. He was seen as an intern as early as "My Super Ego" (episode 1.07) but was not credited. He was first mentioned in the episode "My Porcelain God" (3.13) by J.D. (he asked "Where my ho's at?". to which J.D. replied "I haven't seen them"). He was given the name Snoop Dogg Resident in the episode "My Fishbowl" (6.12). He is also seen to be an attending in the episode "My Jiggly Ball" (5.04), as he is balancing on a wheelchair with the attendings to see which attending would introduce Kelso at a conference. He later got a snake when a patient who owns a pet store gave it to him, he replied "My ho's are gonna love this". Again he was mentioned in "My Long Goodbye" (6.15). It was revealed he had become an attending in "My Own Worst Enemy" (7.01) after J.D. incorrectly called him an intern and then a resident.

It was one of the first shows in the UK to use chroma key and one of the first to use stop-motion techniques in a live action format. Other effects include hand editing for repeated movement, mainly used to make animals "talk" or "sing", and play speed effects as used in the episode "Kitten Kong".

A special episode, which was based on the original 1971 Goodies' "Kitten Kong" episode, was called "Kitten Kong: Montreux '72 Edition", and was first broadcast in 1972. The Goodies won the Silver Rose in 1972 for this special episode at the Festival Rose d'Or, held in Montreux, Switzerland. In the first episode of the next series, "The New Office", Tim Brooke-Taylor can be seen painting the trophy gold.

Unlike most long-running BBC comedy series, The Goodies has not enjoyed extensive repeats on terrestrial television in the UK. In 1986 BBC2 broadcast the episode "Kitten Kong" during a week of programmes screened under the banner TV-50, when the BBC celebrated 50 years of Broadcasting. In the late 1980s, the pan-European satellite-channel Super Channel broadcast a couple of episodes and the short-lived Comedy Channel broadcast some of the later Goodies episodes in the early 1990s. Later UK Gold screened many of the earlier episodes, often with commercial timing cuts. The same episodes subsequently aired on UK Arena, also cut. When UK Arena became UK Drama, later UKTV Drama, The Goodies was dropped along with its other comedy and documentary shows.

In December 2010 BBC Two showed selected late night repeats of the BBC series, which ran nightly from 23–30 December. This apparent gesture followed years of campaigning by The Goodies that the shows had not been repeated like other BBC shows such as Dad's Army and Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. The episodes actually shown were: "Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms" / "Earthanasia" / "The Goodies and the Beanstalk" / "Kitten Kong" / "Lighthouse Keeping Loonies" / "Saturday Night Grease" / "The Baddies" (a.k.a. "Double Trouble") and "The Stone Age", although "Scoutrageous", "Kung Fu Kapers" and "Scotland" (a.k.a. "Loch Ness Monster") were originally billed as episodes 1, 2 and 7 of the repeat run. They were shown late at night where they were unlikely to gain many new fans, although they did garner good ratings given their time slot, and the first six episodes were taken from the BBC's own master tapes, rather than the digital remasters, the rights to which are currently owned by Network Video, "The Baddies" and "The Stone Age" have never been digitally remastered.

An animated King Kong appears in The Beatles' 1968 movie Yellow Submarine, and The Simpsons spoofed King Kong during a segment of their "Treehouse of Horror III" Halloween episode, in which Homer was Kong. It ends with him marrying Marge and eating her father. King Kong appears among the good guys in an episode of South Park in the episode "Imaginationland". The British Comedy TV Show The Goodies made an episode called Kitten Kong, in which a giant cat called Twinkle roams the streets of London, knocking over The British Telecom Tower.

Meatwad has the power to pull items out of his body. In "Robositter", Meatwad is frozen, shatters on the floor, and instantly reassembles. In "Multiple Meat" it is revealed that Meatwad can multiply, by being cut in half. Just like Frylock's "Frydar" and Master Shake's "Shake Power", Meatwad has the power to be able to turn his meat body into a variety of shapes. Most times Meatwad assumes the shape of an igloo, or a hot dog, and sometimes a samurai Abraham Lincoln, which he identifies as Wayne Gretzky and Dick Nixon in "Dickesode". Meatwad can take the shape of many other things such as a hammer, "The Meat monster", a large office building, a net, a bridge, a hand giving people the finger, a working gun, a flower. In "Rabbot Redux", while playing rock-paper-scissors with Shake, Meatwad turned into a large piece of notebook paper and a tornado, the latter actually causing a storm in Meatwad's room. Presumably he can also take the shape of scissors, as he was playing "rock paper scissors" when he became the Paper, Meatwad takes the shape of a dog in "One Hundred", which is a parody of Scooby-Doo, from the television series, Scooby-Doo. Also Meatwad appears as a giant number 5, on the volume five DVD cover, and a Christmas tree on the cover of Have Yourself a Meaty Little Christmas.

Meanwhile, Jake and Eric are still in the New Bern jail, and they are subjected to torture by the New Bern police, who are trying to learn more about Jericho's defenses. Jake and Eric soon find themselves sharing a cell with Maggie Mullen, one of the fake Marines from Semper Fidelis. Maggie says that their group decided to split up after leaving Jericho, and she ended up getting arrested in New Bern after attempting to steal some supplies. She mentions to Jake that if he had access to somebody on the outside that she could bargain for her freedom and then return for him and Eric. Hearing his brother's screams of pain during a torture session in an interrogation room, Jake gives Maggie the information about Hawkins that she believes will earn her freedom. She reports to her captors that "his name is Hawkins" and gives them his likely location, at Ted's cabin. They order her to return to her cell, but she pleads that according to the original deal she was to be taken along to verify Hawkins' location and then set free if the tip checked out. Begrudgingly she is taken to Ted's cabin along with three armed officers of New Bern's police force.

In his original script for "Fire at Rig 15", Bryan Cooper named the Middle East oil refinery as "Bethsheba". Incidental music for this episode was specially recorded on 22 July 1967 (1967-07-22) using a 15-musician orchestra, producing a suite called "Rig 15" which has been commercially released on CD. Music for the episode "Shadow of Fear" was also recorded in the four-hour studio session.

Danny Bolen (formerly Tyler; Beau Mirchoff) is the son of Angie and Nick Bolen. He comments that he did not want to move to Fairview, to which his mother replied "Oh, honey. Whose fault was that?" He has feelings for Julie, but is prone to random fits of anger around her, and thus becomes a suspect after Julie is strangled. Danny confronts his father after he discovers his father's affair with Julie. After Julie tells Danny she will never be with him, he attempts to commit suicide, but fails. Later at the hospital, he is being looked after by Nurse Mona Clarke, who lives on Wisteria Lane. When Mona calls him by name, a dazed Danny says that his name is Tyler. He starts dating Ana Solis, which concerns Angie, as she is afraid that Ana is going to break his heart someday. He goes to New York City to talk with Ana about her supposed modeling job and reconnects with his grandmother. It also revealed that Patrick Logan is his biological father, but he does not know this and thinks of Nick as his real dad. Patrick meets Danny Patrick in episode "We All Deserve to Die", and tells Danny that he is writing a novel, which in reality is the story of how Patrick and Angie met. Patrick asks Danny for advice on how to "end the novel" and Danny, believing it is all fiction, suggests that the main character kill "the girl", for taking away the main character's kid (who takes the role of Danny). When Patrick runs Nick over, Angie tells Danny to escape, and though she reveals Patrick's past as an eco-terrorist, she misses out the important fact of their relationship. Danny is about to leave town, but is tricked by Patrick into returning, and is held hostage along with Angie. Patrick reveals to Danny the truth about his paternity. Patrick attempts to kill Danny by making Angie build a bomb and placing it in the Bolens' house; however, Angie planted the bomb within the detonator and Patrick is killed, while Danny is saved by Gabrielle. Later, while Angie and Nick relocate to Atlanta, Danny is seen relocating to New York to be with his grandmother and Ana.

Each Martian machine was topped with an articulated metal neck/arm, culminating in the cobra-like head, housing a single electronic eye that operated both like a periscope and as a weapon. The electronic eye also housed the Martian heat ray, which pulsed and fired red sparking beams, all accompanied by thrumming and a high-pitched clattering shriek when the ray was used. The distinctive sound effect of the weapon was created by an orchestra performing a written score, mainly through the use of violins and cellos. For many years, it was utilized as a standard ray-gun sound on children's television shows and the science-fiction anthology series The Outer Limits, particularly in the episode "The Children of Spider County".

In contrast with Nathan-Turner's attitude that the sonic screwdriver should not be used as a cure-all, the new production team gave it even more functionality than previous versions which has given the series some criticism as it seems to be a deus ex machina, a literary device that is generally avoided. Some of the uses in the new series include: repairing electronic equipment; re-attaching materials such as barbed wire; detecting, intercepting and sending signals; remotely operating the TARDIS; burning, cutting, or igniting substances; fusing metal; scanning and identifying substances; amplifying or augmenting sound; modifying mobile phones to enable "universal roaming”; disabling alien disguises; resonating concrete; reversing teleportation of another entity. It is sometimes used to disassemble robotic enemies or turn other objects into weapons; healing cuts and wounds. In "The Parting of the Ways" and "Utopia" it is used to operate the TARDIS controls remotely; when the Doctor attempts to counteract the Master's theft of the TARDIS, it is used to limit the TARDIS' destination. In "Doomsday", the Doctor states that the sonic screwdriver does not kill, wound or maim; however, it is sometimes brandished in a threatening manner, such as in "The Christmas Invasion", "The Impossible Planet", "The Runaway Bride", "The Lazarus Experiment" and The Infinite Quest. In "World War Three", when confronted by a group of Slitheen, the Doctor threatens to "triplicate the flammability" of a bottle of port wine with the sonic screwdriver, though one of the Slitheen realises he is bluffing. In "Closing Time", ringed energy beams are seen emitted from the device, giving it a more weapon-like appearance, particularly when used to disable a weakened Cyberman at a distance.

TARDISes are bioships that are grown from a species of coral presumably indigenous to Gallifrey, as stated in "The Impossible Planet", (2006) and it can take years to complete one. They draw their power from several sources, but primarily from the Eye of Harmony, an exploding star in the process of becoming a black hole suspended in a permanent state of decay. In The Edge of Destruction (1964), the power source of the TARDIS (referred to as the "heart of the TARDIS") is said to be beneath the central column of the console. They are also said to draw power from the entire universe as revealed in the episode "Rise of the Cybermen" (2006), in which the TARDIS is brought to a parallel universe and cannot function without the use of a crystal power source from within the TARDIS, charged by the Doctor's life force.

The TARDIS also grants its passengers the ability to understand and speak other languages. This was previously described in The Masque of Mandragora (1976) as a "Time Lord gift " which the Doctor shared with his companions, but was ultimately attributed to the TARDIS's telepathic field in "The End of the World" (2005). In "The Christmas Invasion", it was revealed that the Doctor himself is an integral element of this capability. Rose is unable to understand the alien Sycorax whilst the Doctor is in a regenerative crisis. In "The Impossible Planet" (2006), it is said that the TARDIS normally even translates writing; in that episode, the TARDIS is unable to translate an alien script, which the Doctor claims makes the language "impossibly old". However, the TARDIS does not translate Gallifreyan, as seen in "Utopia", when the Doctor was reading Gallifreyan numbers from the console monitor to tell where the TARDIS was going, and again in "A Good Man Goes to War", in which the Gallifreyan script on the Doctor's crib remains unintelligible to the audience and the Ponds. River Song also explains in "A Good Man Goes to War" that the TARDIS' translation matrix can take "a while to kick in" for the written word, actually coming into effect after the departure of the Doctor and the TARDIS. In the Ninth Doctor Adventures novel Only Human, the telepathic field includes a filter that replaces foul or undesirable language with more acceptable terms. In "The Fires of Pompeii", it is shown that if a TARDIS traveller speaks in a hearer's own language, the translation circuit renders these words appropriately as foreign to the listener's ear (for example, if an English-speaking TARDIS traveller speaks Latin to an ancient Roman, the Roman hears that Latin as "Celtic" or Welsh). It also affects the translation of accents: in "Vincent and the Doctor", a translated Scottish accent is heard by a Dutchman and understood as a Dutch accent (though that accent-translation was also an outside reference to the speaker and hearer both being played by actors whose native accent was Scottish). The translation circuit does not always function, even for the Doctor. In Four to Doomsday, the Doctor is unable to understand the Aboriginal dialect spoken by a tribesman and the Doctor's companion Tegan. Similarly, Martha Jones is initially unable to understand the Hath in the episode "The Doctor's Daughter" and although she is eventually able to communicate with them, the audience is never allowed to understand their words.

TARDISes are characterised not just by their ability to travel in time, but also their dimensionally transcendent nature. A TARDIS's interior spaces exist in a different dimension from its exterior, allowing it to appear to be bigger on the inside. The Doctor states that transdimensional engineering was a key Time Lord discovery in "The Robots of Death". In the revived series, the TARDIS has an organic look, and the Doctor states in "The Impossible Planet" that TARDISes are grown, not made.

The Doctor's relationship with Rose intensifies after he regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. In the 2006 series, while possessed by Lady Cassandra, Rose kisses the Doctor. In "School Reunion", the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. In the episode, "The Girl in the Fireplace" (written by Steven Moffat), the Tenth Doctor shares a passionate kiss with Madame de Pompadour, who takes him away to "dance", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode "The Doctor Dances") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not seem to exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, although it is described as "a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive." In "The Impossible Planet" the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment when they have to consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor's spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In "The Satan Pit" the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone "If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows". In "Doomsday", when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him. He begins to reply, but the message is cut off, and he is unable to reciprocate; in the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner had stated that "he absolutely was going to say it...he was going to tell her he loved her." The reunion between the Doctor and Rose in 2008 episode "The Stolen Earth" is stated by executive producer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Confidential to be a parody of romantic film conventions, because the heightened emotional content is abruptly interrupted by the Doctor being shot by a Dalek. In the next episode, "Journey's End", Rose challenges the Doctor to say what he didn't get to say before, to which he replies, "Does it need saying?". His half-human clone, however, does whisper it into Rose's ear, and the two of them kiss; Rose gets an emphatically romantic resolution to her romance storyline, as the clone-Doctor and Rose continue to live together on a parallel Earth. Gardner commented in Confidential that although the audience cannot hear, it is obvious that he is saying "I love you".

The Tenth Doctor is more extroverted and gregarious than his predecessor, quickly establishing a firmer rapport with Rose Tyler's friends and family than he ever did in his previous incarnation. He is openly fond of mankind and is apparently in awe of their tenacity and curiosity, a trait previously exhibited by his fourth incarnation. In "The Impossible Planet", he hugs the leader of an Earth expedition for daring to explore a planet orbiting a black hole merely "because it was there". In "The Age of Steel", he describes human beings as both brilliant and stupid in the same sentence while arguing the necessity of emotions with the Cyber-Controller. The Doctor even goes so far as to exclaim he's willing to battle the Master across the cosmos so long as he leaves Earth alone in "The Sound of Drums". However, he is also quick to criticise mankind when he feels it is necessary. Indeed, his confidence in the human race becomes far less pronounced in later series, and at the end of "Midnight" he is left speechless after witnessing the steps humans can become willing to take when placed in a threatening situation, as he is almost killed by a panicky group of people who turn on him.

Blue acts as commander of Cloudbase during Colonel White's absence in "White as Snow" and replaces Lieutenant Green as the bases communications officer in "Avalanche". However, he occasionally disobeys commands out of his own curiosity. For example, he refuses to leave a rocket base targeted by its own missile in "Renegade Rocket", choosing to remain behind with Captain Scarlet in a desperate attempt to find the projectile's self-destruct code.

James Wong, a Hong Kong-born writer raised in the US, was a writer, co-executive producer and consulting producer of The X-Files in its first, second and fourth seasons (1993-1997); co-creator, producer and writer of the TV series Space: Above and Beyond (1995-1996); and writer, consulting producer and co-executive producer of Millennium in its first and second seasons (1996-1998). Before The X-Files, Wong had worked as a writer on police dramas such as 21 Jump Street, The Commish, Booker and Wiseguy as well as on the script for the independent crime film The Boys Next Door (1984), starring Charlie Sheen in his first leading role. Wong later wrote, produced and directed horror and action films such as Final Destination (2000) and the Jet Li-starring The One (2001), and he was hired by 20th Century Fox to direct Dragonball Evolution (2009), although like other producers and crew members on that production, complained of having little creative input as the studio made all the major decisions. As part of the initial production crew on The X-Files, Wong was among the most influential four writer-producers who worked closely with X-Files creator Chris Carter to define the characters, plots and aesthetics of the new series (the others were Glen Morgan, Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa). Wong was responsible with his longtime writing partner Glen Morgan for introducing a number of elements that defined The X-Files throughout its run. Wong co-wrote "Squeeze," only the second X-Files episode ever produced, and the first "monster of the week" episode, which would provide a template for two thirds of the future episodes of the series; "Ice," the first episode to focus centrally on the Mulder/Scully relationship as the key to its plot; "Beyond the Sea," the first episode to receive notable critical acclaim beyond the science fiction genre, the first episode with serious character development for Gillian Anderson in her role as Dana Scully, and also Carter's personal favorite episode of the series; "E.B.E.," the first episode to introduce The Lone Gunmen trio of characters, whose popularity resulted in their own short-lived spinoff series (without Wong's participation) in 2001; "Tooms," the first episode to introduce the character of Walter Skinner, Mulder and Scully's boss, who would become a more central character over the remainder of the series, and also the first episode to give a speaking part to the Cigarette Smoking Man, the main nemesis of Mulder and Scully for most of the series' run; "Little Green Men," the first mythology episode to make use of voiceover and flashback; "Blood," the first episode to include a story contribution from Glen Morgan's brother Darin Morgan, who would become the most acclaimed X-Files writer and the only one to win an Emmy for his writing; "3," the first episode in which Mulder or Scully was involved in a sexual situation; "One Breath," the resolution episode for the abduction plot that was the foundation of the series' long running mythology; "Die Hand Die Verletzt," the first episode in which Kim Manners, who became the series' most prolific director over its nine seasons, was brought on board to direct, being an acquaintance of Morgan and Wong from their work with Manners on previous TV series; and "Home," the first episode to be preceded by a warning from the network that it was intended for mature audiences only due to its disturbing content. James Wong, in his directorial debut, also directed the episode "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man," for which he received an Emmy nomination, also becoming the first member of the series's regular writing staff (after Chris Carter) to direct an episode, as well as the only person of color to ever direct an X-Files episode. Wong's Emmy nomination for directing "Musings" made him the first Asian American to receive an Emmy nomination for directing anything on television; at that time, no Asian American and no person of Chinese descent had yet been nominated for an Oscar for directing a film. Wong was also, along with Chris Carter (nominated a year later) the only director of an X-Files episode to be Emmy nominated for his work. As part of The X-Files main production team in 1994-1995, Wong shared the show's first Golden Globe Award win for Best Dramatic Series, and also shared its second win (The X-Files would become the first series to win a Golden Globe three times) in the 1996-1997 season.

The score for "Terms of Endearment" was composed by series regular Mark Snow, who used Gregorian chants to give the atmosphere a "creepy" feel. The 1995 song "Only Happy When It Rains" by alternative rock group Garbage plays several times in the episode, most notably when Betsy Monroe drives away with her demon baby. The quote "Zazas, zazas, nasatanada zazas"—what Laura Weinsider was to have said while "in a trance"—is what the occultist Aleister Crowley used to open the 10th Aethyr of the Thelemic demon Choronzon. "Terms of Endearment" is not the first occasion that the series drew influence from Crowley; a high school from the episode "Die Hand Die Verletzt" was named after him as well.

When Brian approaches Stewie about helping him find a tennis ball he has buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day that the first episode of Family Guy originally aired). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, but notice that their past looks more strange than they remembered it: the family continually pauses for cutaways, the animation style is different, and Meg's voice sounds different. Stewie comments that "She sounds like someone who's about to give up a huge opportunity" (Lacey Chabert soon quit her role as Meg). Telling Brian that he must not alter the past by getting the tennis ball and that he should instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian falls onto past Peter's car as he drives to the stag party at Past Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination (Stewie converted the return pad to run on batteries instead of uranium because of their situation in Germany). Later, the two manage to take advantage of Past Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. Before their return, they have an encounter with the Kool-Aid Guy and ruin his entry during the "Oh yeah!" part at Past Peter's court session.

Los Angeles Times reviewer Patrick Kevin Day stated that at this point in the series, he "initially fretted that Fringe would never grow beyond a run-of-the-mill "X-Files" knock-off," but now saw the creators' intentions. Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X-Files episode "D.P.O.", whose featured character has a similar premise to Meegar. Stegall admitted that "this show is growing on me," with the same atmosphere as The X-Files "coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science." Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend reacted positively towards the episode, commending it as it "bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would've lost me forever." Dougherty also felt that the three protagonists, Olivia, Walter and Peter, "are becoming much more believable characters." Noel Murray of the A.V. Club rated the episode a B−, opining that the cold open was the series' best since the pilot, but added that "despite the added  sympathy, 'Power Hungry' promptly peters out, because the level of oddity required for Walter and the Pattern Team to track the Freak down isn't especially high." Murray added that the return of Scott and his scenes with Olivia "serves to string along the home viewer, inviting us to question whether Olivia's playing for the right team in this whole Pattern game." Television Without Pity meanwhile, graded the episode with an A−.	Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X-Files episode "D.P.O.	/m/027jy2q	D.P.O.	74	80	/tv/tv_series_episode

The season fourteen episodes 200 and 201 were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they "will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show." The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser (who prefers to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee), said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest. Despite al Amrikee's claims that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat. Support for the episode has come in the form of Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!, a movement started on Facebook that encourages people to draw Muhammad on May 20.

Another enduring satirical reference is in the animated series South Park, most notably in the episode "Mecha-Streisand", where Streisand is portrayed as a self-important, evil, gigantic robotic dinosaur with a terrible singing voice about to conquer the universe before being defeated by Robert Smith of The Cure. On another occasion, the Halloween episode "Spookyfish" is promoted for a week as being done in "Spooky-Vision", which involves Streisand's face seen at times during the episode in the four corners of the screen. At the end of the feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, her name is used as a powerful curse word, a gag repeated in the episode "Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants". The Mecha-Streisand character made a return in the Season 14 episodes "200" and "201", as one of several celebrities the show had lampooned over the years.

South Park episodes "200" and "201" aired in April 2010, revisiting the issue of the Islamic religious figure Muhammad's perceived immunity to parody, for fear of violent retaliation. The Super Best Friends return, but Muhammad is entirely covered by a black bar reading "CENSORED" through all of his screen time. By the second episode of the two-parter, Comedy Central decided to censor every instance of his name, as well as three entire monologues, from the end of the show. The monologues dealt with the subjects of censorship and intimidation, but did not actually use Muhammad's name. Parker and Stone have since issued a statement to the press, confirming that the "bleeps" were added weeks after the show was finished, and that Comedy Central has refused to let them post the original version to South Park Studios, in addition to retroactively removing the original "Super Best Friends" episode.

On April 21, 2010, Comedy Central censored the South Park episode, "201", in response to a death threat issued by users of a radical Muslim website over the episode's planned depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which led several newspaper columnists to condemn the network's actions as tantamount to abetting terrorism. As a result, "201" and the episode that preceded it were heavily edited and not shown in repeats.

The Simpsons crew has a friendly relationship with South Park, which they demonstrated several times, going as far as sending flowers to the South Park studios when South Park parodied Family Guy in the season 10 episodes "Cartoon Wars Part I" and "Part II". In 2010, The Simpsons crew congratulated South Park for reaching 200 episodes, with a message reading "Congratulations on 200 Episodes. (We Already Did It.) (Twice.)", referring to The Simpsons' run of more than 400 episodes at the time, and alluding to "Simpsons Already Did It". Soon after, in reference to the controversies and terrorist threats surrounding depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad in the South Park episodes "200" and "201", the chalkboard gag on that week's Simpsons episode, "The Squirt and the Whale", read "South Park – We'd stand beside you if we weren't so scared". South Park was parodied in a 2003 Simpsons episode, "The Bart of War", showing a scene with the four South Park boys Stan, Kyle, and Cartman drawn in Simpsons style, with Marge disapproving of Bart and Milhouse's apparent enjoyment of "cartoon violence", and the latter two contemplating about adults voicing children's characters. The 2009 Simpsons episode "O Brother, Where Bart Thou?" has Bart, Milhouse, Nelson and Ralph dressed up as, standing at the bus stop – similarly to the iconic bus stop scenes of South Park –, and Otto using the catchphrase "Oh my God! I killed Kenny!" when he hits Ralph (dressed as Kenny) driving the school bus.

Derek Nimmo made his name as the Reverend Mervyn Noote in the British sitcom All Gas and Gaiters (1966). At the time it was considered rather controversial because the main characters were senior churchmen (the Bishop, his chaplain Noote and the Archdeacon) who got into various scrapes as a result of their general incompetence. By the time the series finished, Nimmo was identified with the stereotype of a traditional British clergyman and he went on to play a bungling monk in another BBC clerical sitcom, Oh, Brother! and its sequel series Oh, Father!. Another sitcom in which he appeared in a starring role as a clergyman, many years later, was Hell's Bells. He also appeared as the Reverend Jonathan Green in a television production of Cluedo.

The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell said "Medicinal Fried Chicken" served as a good social satire without becoming too preachy. Modell particularly enjoyed that the other South Park men joined Randy in his absurd testicular cancer scheme, but said the Cartman subplot and drug film parody "fell a little flat". Ramsley Isler of IGN said the giant testes jokes were "brilliantly ludicrous", and did not grow old despite running throughout the length of the episode. Isler praised the ending scene with the scrotum skin coat, and said when Cartman snorted chicken skin like cocaine, "the episode reached a whole new level hilarity". TV Fanatic declared the episode "perfection" and felt it was an improvement over the previous fourteenth season episodes "Sexual Healing" and "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs". The site also praised the episode for use gross-out comedy like enlarged testicles for social satire as well as humor. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine praised the humor, the references to Scarface and the social commentary, of which he said: "The points were smart, articulate, and, in true South Park style, completely off the wall".

"The Satan Pit" is the ninth episode of the second season of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It is the second part of a two-part story, following "The Impossible Planet". With the TARDIS seemingly lost, Rose and the remaining humans are trapped on the base with the possessed Ood, while the planet floats helplessly towards a black hole. Meanwhile, the Doctor is about to discover exactly what "Beast" is trapped in the heart of the impossible planet.	It is the second part of a two-part story, following "The Impossible Planet".	/m/0c7jnj	The_Impossible_Planet	54	75	/tv/tv_series_episode
The episode opens where "The Impossible Planet" left off, with the Doctor and science officer Ida Scott investigating a strange door deep in the planet Krop Tor. Rose and the rest of the crew flee from the advancing Ood, who have all been possessed by the Beast and are killing people with their translators. The group initially believe Toby to be possessed by the Beast, but change their minds after a force leaves his body and enters the Ood. The Doctor makes contact with the crew, revealing that nothing has exited the door outside. He offers to rappel down into the pit to further investigate, but Captain Zach orders everyone to regroup so that he can execute "strategy nine". Ida and the Doctor become trapped when the lift cable snaps and leaves them stranded.

In the 2006 series of Doctor Who, Woolf returned to provide the voice of "The Beast" in the two part story "The Impossible Planet" and "The Satan Pit".

Unlike the two-part stories from the 2005 series, this episode featured no "Next time" trailer for the next episode — only a title card reading "To be continued...", the first time the phrase has ever been used to end an episode in the programme's history. The production team had stated previously that one episode in this series was so long that there was no time for a preview. Many viewers, and writer Steven Moffat, had criticised the use of a preview for "World War Three" at the end of the 2005 episode "Aliens of London" as it spoiled the dramatic cliffhanger ending. Beginning with "The Impossible Planet", trailers for the second part of stories were run during the middle eight, after the main credits, to allow viewers time to switch off.

The depiction of the Mediæval world in The Black Adder has been the subject of some critical commentary for drawing on popular perceptions of the period which are not always entirely accurate. While the series uses absurdly comic situations to mock religion and belief, the scripts of both The Archbishop and the later episode Witchsmeller Pursuivant have been attributed to a post-Reformation perception of Mediæval Catholicism; Archbishops were not routinely assassinated and hysteria about witches was not widespread in England until the 1640s.

By the third season opener "Gay Witch Hunt", Ryan becomes a full-time employee and inherits the job (and desk) vacated by Jim Halpert. Despite the promotion, Michael still treats Ryan as his personal assistant. Upon Jim's return to Scranton after the branch merger, there is a moment of awkwardness when Jim casually sets up at his former desk, only to learn that it now belongs to Ryan—who refuses to give the desk back to Jim, the first hint at a rivalry between the two.

Due to his overall lack of common sense, Michael can withstand significant abuse from his peers and is often the butt of jokes. He is quick to take offense when he realizes he is being wronged and his response is often disproportionate to the harm suffered; similarly, he tends to unintentionally offend people, but will usually sincerely apologize on the rare occasion that he realizes he has inadvertently insulted someone, the most notable example being in "Gay Witch Hunt" when he cries upon realizing his use of the term "faggy" hurt Oscar's feelings. Even though he is generally oblivious to criticism, derision and sarcasm, Michael has some limits to his patience, and leaves to question the extent of offense that he can actually acknowledge (demanding professional respect from Stanley Hudson in "Did I Stutter?" or standing up to the employees in favor of Holly in "Business Ethics").

A major part of the character Jim Halpert is his relationship with Pam Beesly, which is often the subject of office speculation. This is made worse by the fact that Pam was engaged to Roy Anderson, a Dunder Mifflin warehouse worker. Throughout the first two seasons, incidents such as Pam falling asleep on Jim's shoulder in "Diversity Day" and drunkenly kissing him in "The Dundies" show a possibility of the feelings being mutual; however, Pam never acts on them and she remains engaged to Roy. On one occasion, in "The Fight," his flirting with her goes a little too far, when Meredith looks over to see him play-fighting with her, causing her to shut him down immediately, startling him with her abruptness, though she eventually forgives him. He becomes so upset when he hears Pam discuss wedding details that he calls a travel agency and schedules a trip to Australia, deliberately making himself unable to attend the wedding. Tortured by his situation with Pam, Jim investigates a transfer to Dunder Mifflin's branch in Stamford, Connecticut. In the season 2 finale, "Casino Night", he confesses his love for Pam in the parking lot of Dunder Mifflin. Pam, whose wedding to Roy was planned out and just weeks away, clearly shows her anguish but gently turns him down. Jim tearfully walks away, later kisses her in the office, and the season ends. In the third season premiere "Gay Witch Hunt", it is revealed that he did transfer to Stamford despite the fact that Pam has called off her wedding and he clearly still harbors intense feelings for her. His reason is later stated as "It's just, I kinda put it all on the line. Twice. And she said no. Twice." in "The Convention".

Season three marks a turning point for Pam's character: she gains self-confidence and appears less passive and more self-assured as the season progresses. In "Gay Witch Hunt," the season's opener, it is revealed that Pam got cold feet before her wedding and did not marry Roy after all, and that Jim transferred to a different Dunder Mifflin branch, in Stamford, shortly after Pam rejected him a second time, after their kiss. Pam moves into her own apartment, begins taking art classes, a pursuit that Roy had previously dismissed as a waste of time, and buys a new car, a blue Toyota Yaris. Jim returns to Scranton later on as a result of "The Merger", and brings along a female co-worker, Karen Filippelli, whom he begins dating. Jim and Pam appeared to have ended all communication after Jim transfers to the Stamford branch (aside from an episode in which Jim accidentally calls Pam at the end of the work day), and their episodes together following the branch merge are tense, despite both admitting to still harboring feelings for the other during the presence of the documentary cameras.

As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government, most of the scenes take place in private locations, such as offices and exclusive members' clubs.

Menzel has a recurring guest star role in the television series Glee, playing Shelby Corcoran, the coach of the rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline. When the series first premiered, Glee fans had noted a strong physical resemblance between Menzel and Lea Michele who portrays the character Rachel Berry. According to her husband, actor Taye Diggs, Menzel expressed interest in possibly guest starring as the biological mother of Rachel. The character was introduced in the April 13, 2010 episode "Hell-O", and it was revealed in the May 18, 2010 episode, "Dream On", that Shelby is, in fact, Rachel's biological mother, having answered an ad from Rachel's two gay dads looking for a 'mother' to help them have a baby. Lea Michele and Idina Menzel sing "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Misérables and "Poker Face" originally by Lady Gaga together.

During the summer between seasons two and three, Quinn undergoes a transformation: she dyes her hair, gets a tattoo and a nose ring, and takes to smoking behind the bleachers with her new clique the Skanks. However, in "I Am Unicorn", when Shelby Corcoran joins the McKinley High faculty and talks to Quinn about being involved in Beth's life, Quinn pretends to clean up her act and returns to New Directions. What she intends is not to merely be in Beth's life, but to get full custody of her daughter. Her attempts to prove Shelby an unfit mother fail; eventually, she realizes with Rachel's help that Shelby is Beth's true mother, and stops trying to reclaim Beth. Shelby resigns and leaves McKinley. Quinn subsequently receives a college acceptance letter from Yale. At the end of "On My Way", while driving to Finn and Rachel's wedding, her car is struck by a truck and she suffers a spinal injury that requires her to use a wheelchair for many weeks. She is eventually able to walk again, and even to dance in performance with the glee club.

Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies) is a student at McKinley. Her father is the wealthy owner of a piano business who donates three repossessed pianos to the glee club in "The Purple Piano Project", the episode in which she first appears. Sugar has self-diagnosed Asperger syndrome, which she uses to explain why she can say whatever she wants. After the glee club performs in the school cafeteria in the hopes of recruiting new students, Sugar shows up to audition, telling the club that they're terrible but she's awesome and will be their new star. Her audition is a stunningly horrendous rendition of "Big Spender", and she becomes the first person who fails to get into New Directions after auditioning. In "I Am Unicorn", her father makes a huge donation to the school to set up a second glee club that will feature Sugar as the star, and recruits Shelby Corcoran to direct it. When Mercedes, Santana and Brittany join, Sugar assumes they'll be her backup singers, but Santana openly tells her she's not a good singer, and she should stay out of their way, at which point Sugar admits that she "just wanted to be on the winning team for once". Sugar has subsequently been seen dancing and singing in several polished performances, indicating that she has greatly improved. After the Troubletones place second at Sectionals, Shelby resigns as director, and the Troubletones are told they are all welcome in New Directions, Sugar accompanies Mercedes, Santana and Brittany when they return, and sings "We Are Young" with the group. Her first in-tune solo was in "Summer Nights" in "Yes/No". In "Heart", she gives Will money to pay for costumes and makeup for Regionals, and throws a big Valentine's Day party. Artie and Rory compete to be her date at the party, and Rory is chosen after his claim that he is being deported at the end of the school year wins her sympathy.

Shelby returns in the second episode of season three, "I Am Unicorn", having been recruited to lead a second glee club at McKinley High by Sugar Motta's father when Sugar is refused entry into New Directions. Shelby offers to include both Quinn and Puck in Beth's life. In "Pot o' Gold", Shelby tells Puck that she is struggling at being a mother; as the episode ends, they kiss.

On April 1913, "preshocks" of the Rift's opening in "End of Days" manifested as ground tremors. Before the dawn of time, as with the Beast, Biblical demon Abaddon had been sealed away in Earth, using the Rift as a means for his imprisonment.

Series creator David Wolstencroft believed that writing Tom was the most fun, yet hardest to work on. During the second series, the producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return for the third; because of this, Tom was originally killed in the second series finale. However, when Macfadyen decided to appear in the first two episodes of the third series, series writer Howard Brenton had to "unkill him." Reaction towards the character by fans were positive, though critics were mixed about Macfadyen's portrayal. Tom Quinn would later appear again as a cameo on the final episode of Spooks; his brief return was met with generally positive reactions.

Though Macfadyen enjoyed working in the series, he began to feel "very sluggish and fed up" with playing the same character for two years. When the producers knew Macfadyen planned to leave, they did not know whether or not he would appear in the beginning of the third series. Howard Brenton, who wrote the series two finale, originally killed Tom off by drowning him while trying to escape onto the North Sea, while labouring under the impression that he was not to return. The producers would have continued the third series without Tom, however when they heard the actor would be prepared to return for the first two episodes of the third series, they were rewritten to include his character Tom. Brenton had to "unkill him." After a seven year abstance, in October 2011, it was announced that Macfadyen was to make a "fleeting" cameo appearance in the final episode of the series. A Spooks insider stated that his scene "will bring back all the memories of Tom and what the character endured in those first few series."

In "Chickenlover", it was established that Barbrady was the only police officer in town. In later seasons, he was phased out in favor of an actual police force, led by the equally incompetent Sergeant Yates. Barbrady's role in the series has decreased as a result, but he still appears regularly, most recently in "200" while protecting the town, and was considered a possible father for Eric Cartman, having been in the room on the day of the DNA test; however, this was ruled out when the true identity of Eric Cartman's father was revealed in "201".

Jack, a Broncos player, was Cartman's actual father and Liane is his mother after all, meaning also that his nemesis Scott Tenorman is his half-brother.

Phillip "Pip" Pirrup, voiced by Matt Stone, was featured mostly during the first few seasons of the series. He was later relegated to being a background character after his role in the show was replaced by Butters. Pip is originally from England, and shares his name with the main protagonist of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations. Wearing a bow tie and flat cap, he was often teased by his classmates. While largely passive, the only thing that would drive him to anger is when fellow students mistake him for being French. The show's official website has noted that this is in reference to the animosity shared between some natives of Britain and France. A similar gag is seen in South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, in which The Mole, a young French boy, is called "British" by Cartman. Pip is the central figure of an eponymous episode during the show's fourth season. The episode, which does not feature any of the show's other characters, was a comedic retelling of Great Expectations, with Pip assuming the role of his character's namesake. After this titular episode, Pip became a background character with only two further speaking appearances—as a candidate for the new fourth boy in "Professor Chaos" and then being absent for eight years until another brief appearance in "201" to beg the Mecha-Streisand to spare South Park; the mecha responds by stepping on him, killing him.

The red eye phenomenon in the Ood is a symptom of them being possessed. In "The Impossible Planet" and "The Satan Pit" they were under the Beast's control. In The End of Time, the eyes of the Ood turn red when they are possessed by the power of the bleeding time vortex. In "Death is the Only Answer", Albert Einstein is transformed into a red-eyed Ood. In "The Doctor's Wife", an Ood named Nephew is possessed but displays bright green eyes instead of red.	In "The Impossible Planet" and "The Satan Pit" they were under the Beast's control.	/m/0c7jnj	The_Impossible_Planet	4	25	/tv/tv_series_episode
The episode was written by Keith Temple and directed by Graeme Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies had envisioned the Ood's return because their previous appearance, the 2006 two-part story "The Impossible Planet" and "The Satan Pit", had been overshadowed by the appearance of the Devil. Davies subsequently provided Temple with a brief for the episode which included the term "ice planet" and the storyline of a business selling the Ood as a commodity. Temple's drafts of the episode were described as "too dark" and "too old Doctor Who"; Temple stated on the episode's commentary that his early draft was "a six-part  in 45 minutes".

The identity of Mysterion is never revealed in "The Coon". After the episode aired, the question "Who is Mysterion?" became a frequently asked question at the FAQ for the official South Park website, South Park Studios. The answer posted at that site was that "there is no answer", and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know. Parker said it was one of the most common questions he was asked about the show, along with the identity of Cartman's father, which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode "201". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets. The superhero characters from "The Coon" returned in the fourteenth season episodes "Coon 2: Hindsight", "Mysterion Rises" and "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Mysterion is revealed.

Martinez is an accountant at the Scranton, Pennsylvania office of the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin and gets his first name from Nunez, series producer Greg Daniels felt that "Oscar" sounded like a good accountant's name. He is a first generation Mexican-American. He is also openly gay after being outed by his then boss Michael Scott in "Gay Witch Hunt," the third season premiere episode devoted to the outing. However, the character was implied to be gay in the second season episode 'The Secret' when Dwight catches him faking sickness to spend the day with his boyfriend (Dwight remains oblivious to this detail as he was obsessed with proving that Oscar was not ill). As a result, in earlier episodes, many co-workers erroneously attribute him various Mexican stereotypes (e.g. being involved in drug cartels) but after his outing, his stereotypes are more focused on his being gay, particularly by Michael which may explain their conflicted relationship. Nunez explained in an 2008 interview that the character variously feels amusement, pity and hatred towards his fictional boss. He has no specific counterpart in the original British series.

Metebelis III has featured before when the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) took a blue crystal from the planet in The Green Death and returned it in Planet of the Spiders, although it was pronounced differently. The Doctor mentions the Eye of Harmony, which was introduced in The Deadly Assassin. The Doctor puts on the orange spacesuit he wore originally in "The Impossible Planet" / "The Satan Pit" and wore on a number of occasions up to "The Waters of Mars". The Doctor refers to formative earth as being six billion years ago, despite "The Runaway Bride" previously stating that it occurred 4.6 billion years ago (in keeping with the scientific record). The Doctor also refers to the TARDIS as being "wibbly-wobbly," how he described time in "Blink".

Father of Bobby "Bacala" Baccalieri. Soldier in Junior Soprano's crew in his younger days, he owned and worked part-time in a barber shop cutting hair, the shop was a front for his illegal businesses, he sold it after he retired from the family. In "Soprano Home Movies", Tony mentioned to Bobby's son how it was unusual that he never whacked anyone, considering his father was "the fuckin Terminator in that respect", suggesting Bobby, Sr. was responsible for numerous homicides before his retirement. Returned to New Jersey from semi-retirement in 2000. Suffered from lung cancer after a lifelong smoking habit. In "Another Toothpick", Tony Soprano gave him the task of killing Salvatore "Mustang Sally" Intile. The hit was ordered as retribution for the savage unprovoked beating of Bryan Spatafore, brother of Vito Spatafore. Vito was a made man in the Aprile crew at the time. Mustang Sally was Robert's godson but he felt he had always been a problem so he had no reservations about the job and was glad to be of use. Despite his poor health and shortness of breath on exertion, he was able to overwhelm and kill the much younger Mustang Sally and his friend Carlos. Died after choking on blood brought on from his lung and losing control of his car and crashing into a sign post while leaving the scene of his final hit.

Gigi made a final transition in the fall of 2000 when he was granted the role of capo over the Aprile crew, following Richie Aprile's "disappearance" making him the only made guy in the Soprano crime family to serve in three different crews. He wasn't well received by most of his new crew (Donny K, Vito Spatafore, and Eugene Pontecorvo). Ralph Cifaretto took every opportunity to make his life difficult as he had hoped to receive the promotion himself and, Cestone showed clear dislike of Cifaretto. It was also Gigi's idea to have Bobby Bacala, Sr. perform the hit on Mustang Sally, in the episode, "Another Toothpick"; though Tony backs him up on this, both Junior and Ralph feel this shows questionable judgment on Gigi's part.

When the party planning committee splits up, she stays with Angela at the less popular party but they ultimately join the other one. Angela is also seen openly insulting Phyllis by stating that orange was a more "whorish" color than green when Phyllis was wearing an orange sweater (a running insult that includes another Phyllis' clothing color=whoring jab from Angela and Ms. Martin's pointed comments about Phyllis wearing a pristine white dress at her wedding).

A number of critics who viewed the episode when it aired were equally taken with "Asian F". The Atlantic's Kevin Fallon called it Glee's "best ever", while others, including Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly said it was the best one of the new third season. Vanity Fair's Brett Berk wrote, "This week's episode stands out as one of the most cohesive and well acted in the series's pantheon", though he wondered what had happened to the show's humorous side, something also noted by Futterman, who found it to be a significant problem: "Glee's own identity crisis of not knowing whether or not it's a sitcom has made it hard to get deeply invested in its characters." Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that "the producers hit every note (emotional, musical, character, plot) as squarely as Rachel Berry auditioning for a coveted role", and the episode "had emotional truth, character growth, new revelations and really good musical numbers: the kind that seem to emerge organically from the plot and deepen and advance it." AOLTV's Crystal Bell said the episode delivered on the setup in the previous "I Am Unicorn" outing, and said "it definitely seems to echo the glory days" of the first season. TV Guide later included "Asian F" in its list of 2011's Top TV Episodes.

"The Last Sam Weiss" received generally positive reviews from television critics. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the episode "equally surprising in its plotting and pacing", praised Sam and Olivia's scenes together, and believed the ending to be "mind-blowing" and "both startling and thrilling". The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing the first half "wasn't quite as rollicking as last week's episode, because there was a lot more set-up and explanation required to keep the story moving" but "then the second half brought in all the emotion and tension, topped off by an unexpected gut-punch of an ending." Murray admitted his "eyes glazed over a bit" during the search for the "crowbar", believing it to be "little too Lost-y", but "the quirky Corrigan as Weiss helped put all the mumbo-jumbo over".

Within Fringe, the prime and parallel worlds are inexorably linked, hypothesized by the characters as the result of a divergent event in the past that formed the two universes. Quantum entanglement of objects between the two universes is significant, having been shown as part of the function of the doomsday device and an electric typewriter used by shapeshifters to communicate with the parallel universe. The parallel universe appears more technologically advanced than the prime one; in the keystone second season episode "Peter", which takes place primarily in 1985, the parallel universe is shown to have cell phones, and zeppelins appear as a common form of transportation. In the show's present (2009 and onward), John F. Kennedy is alive as an ambassador to the United Nations, and other figures like John Lennon and Martin Luther King, Jr. are also alive. The United States in the parallel universe only consists of 48 states; while there exists a North and South Texas, other single states appear to take the place of two separate states in the prime universe, such as both North and South Carolina being the single "Carolina" in the parallel universe. Furthermore, much of western California has been lost, suggesting that a large earthquake along the San Andreas Fault has caused much of the coastal region to sink below sea level. Other effects on the global scale have caused sheep to become extinct, and made coffee and avocados valuable rarities. The singularities that plague the parallel universe can lead to destructive voids; to prevent these, the Fringe division there uses a fast-setting amber-like substance to prevent weakened areas from becoming destructive, but with no regard for innocents that may be trapped within it. A mass blight has affected vast areas of plant life, such as the area around Boston. While the September 11 attacks still occurred in the parallel universe, only the White House and The Pentagon were attacked, and the World Trade Center remains standing. Other changes exist in the parallel universe's popular culture; Eric Stoltz stars in Back to the Future, the musical Dogs has replaced Cats as the longest running Broadway musical, the Sherlock Holmes books were never written, and many comic book characters are different or do not exist such as Green Arrow being Red Arrow and Batman being the Mantis. In the "Fringe" episode, "6:02 AM EST", a radio broadcast of the Dodgers versus the Expos at Ebbets Field can be heard in the alternate universe, suggesting that the Major League Baseball franchises of the Montreal Expos and the Brooklyn Dodgers were not moved from their original cities.

Critical reaction towards the episode was mostly positive.

Matt Fowler of IGN liked the episode, especially Ben's punch and the group booing Jerry after Millie broke up with Chris. But, he did note that Leslie's hyper-focus, just like in the episode Citizen Knope, can be draining. He ultimately gave the episode an 8 out of 10, or a "Great."

After the events in "Twenty Vicodin", House is serving the remainder of his original remaining four months with another eight tacked on. However, Eric Foreman (who is actually the new Dean of Medicine, because Cuddy resigns the day after the events on "Moving On") makes House an offer: he would receive the opportunity for conditional release and return to the PPTH team to treat a set of donor lungs that are failing, organs that Wilson's patient (Liza Snyder) needs. House is working in medicine again, but he realizes that many things have changed: he now has a tiny office, has a limited supply of Vicodin, lost his team (Chase, Taub and Thirteen have all left for greener pastures), and his relationship with Wilson is challenged once again.
