In 2010, St.Louis travelled to Madrid, Spain to take part in Fox Soccer Channel coverage of the UEFA Champions League Final. Alongside Fox Sports NFL host Curt Menefee and former US International Eric Wynalda, Los Angeles Galaxy coach Bruce Arena, former English player Warren Barton and Fox Soccer Report analyst Bobby McMahon, St.Louis worked the sideline for the pre-game show, half-time and post-game show. His post-match interview with Inter Milan's Wesley Sneijder confirmed the news that manager Jose Mourinho was leaving the club as most other UK broadcasters were trying to break the story. His follow-up interviews with Sulley Muntari and Inter Milan President Massimo Moratti provided confirmation - a coup of sorts for Fox Soccer Channel.

The station is home to one of America's longest-running primetime local newscasts: WNYW (as WNEW-TV) first premiered its 10 p.m. newscast – the first primetime newscast in the New York market – on March 13, 1967. Each night, the newscast (originally known as The 10 O'Clock News until 2001) was preceded by the simple, but now-famous announcement: "It's 10 p.m., Do you know where your children are?", which was coined by Mel Epstein. Staff announcer Tom Gregory was one of the first to utter this famous line that WNEW pioneered; other television stations in the country began using the tagline for their own 10 p.m. (or 11 p.m.) news slots (which may depend on the start of the local youth curfew in each market). Celebrities were often used to read the slogan in the 1980s, and for a time in the late 1970s, the station added a warmer announcement earlier in the day: "It's 6 p.m., have you hugged your child today?" From 1975 to 1985, the 10 p.m. newscast notably featured nightly op-ed debates which pitted conservative Martin Abend against liberal Professor Sidney Offit. The first time WNYW programmed news outside its established 10:00 slot was in 1987, when it premiered a half-hour 7 p.m. newscast; the program was canceled in 1993.

Jorgenson was recruited to WNEW-TV from Cleveland, Ohio, where he had been principal anchor for NBC affiliate KYW-TV (which later became NBC-owned WKYC-TV), and later ABC affiliate WEWS. When WNEW-TV began producing the Ten O'Clock News with Jorgenson at the helm, no other commercial television stations had a prime time newscast, though. New York Times television critic Jack Gould described the newscast as "a thoroughly professional news summary" due in part to "Mr. Jorgensen's durably pleasing style and demeanor. He suggests authority without affectation." The program was perhaps best known for the station break that preceded the newscast, where Tom Gregory announced: "It's 10 P.M. Do you know where your children are?"	" The program was perhaps best known for the station break that preceded the newscast, where Tom Gregory announced: "It's 10 P.M.

Steele voiced the catch phrase, coined by his announcer-booth colleague Tom Gregory: "It's 10 P.M. Do you know where your children are?"

In 1999, to help deal with major overcrowding issues, the school was relocated to a new, larger building, several kilometres away on Riverwood Gate. However, the new building quickly became overcrowded as well, and is now home to over 18 portables. The School has respected athletic programs, namely in basketball and football, and is usually ranked in both sports. It has produced many skilled athletes, including BC Lions slotback Bret Anderson, Saskatchewan Roughriders fullback Chris Szarka, Olympic Gold Medalist Rick Paige, Olympic Bronze Medalist Chris Rinke, race car driver Adrien Herberts and news anchor Lynn Colliar Lynn Colliar.

Félix joined Telemundo Chicago in 2001 as a fill in reporter and anchor for Milenka Peña, a veteran journalist and public figure. The following year she became the station's weather anchor. In addition she provided entertainment and feature reporting for Chicago’s #2 Spanish TV station. In short order, due to the unexpected departure of the news anchors, she was named co-anchor of Telemundo Chicago’s 5 p.m. news and given responsibility for producing and anchoring the morning briefs "Noticiero Telemundo Chicago por la Manaña" that drew record ratings for this time period. She held both these posts until the reporter and community activist Rafael Serrano, then the main anchor, was fired and she was named solo anchor of the 10 p.m. news for Telemundo Chicago.

Hey Hey It's Saturday was a long-running variety television program on Australian television. It initially ran for 27 years (there was a recess in 1978), debuting on the Nine Network on 9 October 1971 and broadcasting its last episode on 20 November 1999. Its host throughout its entire run was Daryl Somers, who would later become executive producer of the program. The original producer, Gavin Disney, left the program in the 1980s and Somers then jointly formed his own production company, Somers Carroll Productions, with on-screen partner Ernie Carroll, the performer of Somers' puppet sidekick Ossie Ostrich.

In January 1962 the national Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled and replaced by The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether he was in a wide shot or a close up. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.

"Troyanos has a sumptuous voice, a very sharp intelligence, enormous ambition, and do-or-die determination to be a great artist," observed British record producer Walter Legge. She sang in Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Edinburgh, Geneva, Milan, Montreal, Munich, Palermo, Paris, Rome, Salzburg, Stockholm, Toronto, Venice, Vienna, Zurich, and throughout the United States. The 1967 Hamburg Opera tour first brought her to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera's new home at Lincoln Center in a selection of twentieth-century repertory including Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, in which she "especially excelled with her rich voice" as Baba the Turk. Her acclaimed appearance as Handel's Ariodante opposite Beverly Sills at the opening of the Kennedy Center in 1971 (under the baton of Julius Rudel, who had originally brought her to the New York City Opera) served to reintroduce her to American audiences. After debuts in Chicago, Dallas, Boston, and notably in San Francisco—where the Chronicle's Robert Commanday wrote of her performance in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, "The means by which Poppea seduces Nero ... could liquefy even stone the way the sensational new mezzo soprano Tatiana Troyanos sang"—she returned to New York to make her Metropolitan Opera debut as Octavian, closely followed by the Composer, in the spring of 1976. "The star of the show was Miss Troyanos ... the most aristocratic Octavian at the Met in years," wrote Speight Jenkins in a review of the Rosenkavalier in the New York Post. "She has a large, warming lyric mezzo-soprano with perfect control ... her singing of the Trio and the final duet was perfection itself." Octavian (her most frequently sung role at the Met, with thirty performances) and the Composer were often described as her signature or calling-card roles.

In 1988, the program title was changed to The Metropolitan Opera Presents, to reflect the fact that the performances were now taped prior to broadcast. Live from the Met functioned as a supplement to the regular Saturday Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. During its first fifteen years, the program was frequently simulcast, enabling some audiences to hear the opera in stereo via radio as well. Hosts of the program included Tony Randall, Beverly Sills, Speight Jenkins, Alexander Scourby, and Garrick Utley. The announcer was Peter Allen.

In the mid-1990s, Blackwell moved away from the soubrette repertoire and began to sing almost exclusively lyric coloratura roles. Instrumental in boosting her profile within this repertoire was Seattle Opera under the direction of Speight Jenkins. Blackwell first worked with the company in 1990 in the role of Marie in La fille du régiment. Impressed with her voice, the company rehired Blackwell periodically throughout the 1990s and 2000s giving her opportunities to sing new repertoire such as the title roles in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and Delibes' Lakmé. She has also sung Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto, and Olympia in Les contes d'Hoffman with the company among other roles. Positive reviews from these performances led to Blackwell's engagement during the late 1990s and 2000s in similar repertoire with many other companies to great acclaim including Teatro Colón de Buenos Aires, Opéra de Nice, Florida Grand Opera, Tulsa Opera, and the Netherlands Opera.

The Wagner's Ring Cycle role of Siegfried — a lengthy, difficult role that very few tenors can sing — brought Morris to international attention beginning in the fall of 2011. His introduction to the role came from a 2008 invitation by Speight Jenkins to understudy the part for Siegfried and Götterdämmerung at the Seattle Opera for their 2009 season. He then also understudied the role at the Los Angeles Opera in 2010. Morris made his debut as Siegfried in Siegfried at the San Francisco Opera in June 2011.

The show was first broadcast on October 2, 1989 as a syndicated sports radio talk show from 6:10 pm – 7:00 pm EST with Bob McCown as the host and Bill Watters as co-host. Newspaper columnist Jim Hunt later became the co-host of the program. When CJCL changed their format to all-sports radio in 1992, Prime Time Sports became the station's afternoon drive show, while also being syndicated nationwide. In 1993, McCown was re-assigned as the station's new morning show host, and Dan Shulman became the program's host in his place. Hunt continued on in his role as co-host. In 1995, Shulman left the station to join TSN, and McCown was re-united with Hunt. Hunt was co-host until 2000 when he was let go by the station. In 2004, Rogers Sportsnet began simulcasting the show on television. As of 2009, the show is available on the "East" regional feed only. In 2005, the program began making the 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. audio content available as a podcast and streaming audio on The FAN 590's website. As of 2009, all three hours of the show are now available as a podcast.

Jeff started out by hosting Live Audio Wrestling, the first wrestling/MMA program available on conventional radio. During the early days of the radio show he got the nickname "Gentleman" Jeff Marek. In 2003, after The LAW had moved from The Fan 590 to Talk 640, Jeff began to host the pre-game and post-game shows for Toronto Maple Leafs telecasts, leading to Jeff leaving The LAW, to work full-time on his other on-air and behind the scenes roles at the recently rebranded Mojo Radio - Talk Radio For Guys. Eventually, Jeff would begin to host a daily talk show on the Toronto Maple Leafs in the afternoon, known as Leafs Lunch. He also hosted his own radio show which aired after Leafs Lunch, called The Jeff Marek Show, until Mojo Radio rebranded its station AM 640 - Toronto Radio.

Since 2003 he competes on the British quiz show Eggheads, teamed up with other quiz champions, in which members of the public pit their wits against them in order to win a cash prize. Alongside his Egghead team mates he also took part in the spin-off show Are You an Egghead? a competition to find further members of the Egghead team resulting in the addition of Barry Simmons in 2008 and Pat Gibson in the second series in 2009. He has never answered a question incorrectly in the History category, and is widely regarded as the strongest of the Eggheads (although in fact, Pat Gibson qualifies for the final round the most often of all the Eggheads, with Kevin coming a close second). However, the Food & Drink category is known to be a weakness for him.	a competition to find further members of the Egghead team resulting in the addition of Barry Simmons in 2008 and Pat Gibson in the second series in 2009.	/m/051_xfw	Barry_Simmons	87	100	/people/person,/tv/tv_personality

The final of Are you an Egghead?: Barry Simmons v. Shaun Wallace: In the final, Barry Simmons came back against all the odds to claim his place as the sixth Egghead. However, during the head-to-head rounds it looked anything but, as Shaun took the first 3 on Music, Geography and Arts and Books to assure he would have the advantage in the final round. It was the fourth head-to-head before Shaun even got an answer wrong, Barry finally winning at Science. Shaun eventually took a 4–1 lead into the final round as he completed the head-to-heads with a win on Sport. With 10 points needed to win the contest, an extraordinary turnaround saw Barry fight back from his deficit to win the match. Shaun went from having answered only one question wrongly in the head-to-heads to getting his first eight in the final wrong. Barry, on the other hand, stormed ahead to lead 8–4 before Shaun finally answered a question correctly, coming back to 9–6.

Despite the album's strong sales, assessments by critics were not overwhelmingly favorable at the time. A negative review was published in Rolling Stone, where John Mendelsohn called the album a disappointing retread of earlier, superior efforts by Young, writing of "the discomfortingly unmistakable resemblance of nearly every song on this album to an earlier Young composition — it's as if he just added a steel guitar and new words to After The Gold Rush." A review in The Montreal Gazette gave the album a mixed verdict, calling it "embarrassing" in places but interesting lyrically, and singling out "Are You Ready for the Country?" as the record's best cut. More recent evaluations of the album have been far more positive: in 1998, Q magazine readers voted Harvest the 64th greatest album of all time. In 1996, 2000 and 2005, Chart polled readers to determine the 50 greatest Canadian albums of all time — Harvest placed second in all three polls, losing the top spot to Joni Mitchell's Blue in 2000, and to Sloan's Twice Removed in the other two polls. In 2003, a full three decades removed from its original harsh assessment, Rolling Stone named Harvest the 78th greatest album of all time. In 2007, Harvest was named the #1 Canadian Album of All Time by Bob Mersereau in his book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.

Architect and planner Al Boeke envisioned a community that would preserve the area's natural beauty. Boeke first surveyed the land in 1962. In 1963, Oceanic California Inc., a division of Castle and Cooke Inc., purchased the land from the Ohlsons and assembled a design team. Principal designers who were recruited by Boeke included American architects Charles Moore, Joseph Esherick, William Turnbull, Jr., Donlyn Lyndon, Richard Whitaker and landscape architect Lawrence Halprin. Halprin created the master plan for Sea Ranch, which grew to encompass 10 miles of the Sonoma County coastline. The principal photographer for the project was the architectural photographer Morley Baer, a friend and colleague of both Turnbull and Halprin.

The meteorological instability in the region resulted in the formation of at least five supercell thunderstorms in the space of around three hours. The storms, which spawned progressively further up the coast from Brisbane to Gladstone as the afternoon progressed, left a trail of damage resulting from hail, rain and wind. The event has been described as "one of the most widespread outbreaks of severe thunderstorms recorded" by veteran meteorologist Richard Whitaker.

Convertible cars, in fashion at the time of the storm, also sustained severe damage, mainly punctures to the soft-top roofs, and trams that ran through the eastern suburbs at the time also suffered damage. According to veteran meteorologist Richard Whitaker, "Sydney was staggered by the enormity of the incident, as there had not been even a remotely similar storm in living memory". The problems were exacerbated due to a lack of building materials available for use in repair work, a result of the Second World War which had concluded only 18 months prior. This contributed to the delays which resulted in houses still covered with only temporary tarpaulins several years later.

While the cloud was visible from space, on the ground the intense red-orange colour and drop in temperature drew comparisons with nuclear winter, Armageddon, and the planet Mars. The dust storm was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as a "pretty incredible event" that was the worst in the state of New South Wales in nearly 70 years. The phenomenon was reported around the world. The Weather Channel's Richard Whitaker said: "This is unprecedented. We are seeing earth, wind and fire together".

He hired landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the master plan for Sea Ranch. Boeke created a committee which reviewed home plans, which restricted homes to two stories with natural colors and mandated underground power lines to preserve the areas natural heritage. Boeke commissioned extensive environmental impact studies, which led to the reseeding of former sheep grazing areas, the removal of debris and logs left by logging, and the replanting of native trees. American architects who were hired as consultants and designers included Joseph Esherick, Donlyn Lyndon, Charles Willard Moore, Richard Whitaker and William Turnbull. The American Institute of Architects awarded a 10-unit Sea Ranch condo building its "award of enduring excellence" in 1991. The Institute said that Sea Ranch "formed an alliance of architecture and nature that has inspired and captivated a generation of architects" at the time.

In 1999, NBC canceled Sunrise and replaced it with a new Early Today, which was originally produced by CNBC and focused on business and financial news before switching to general news under the same production staff as MSNBC First Look. Early Today continues to air on the network. Also in fall 1999, Later Today, a talk show that was intended to air immediately following the parent broadcast, was launched with hosts Jodi Applegate, Florence Henderson and Asha Blake. Sagging ratings for that show caused its cancellation in August 2000; it was replaced two months later by the current third hour of Today.

The Afternoon Show had met with a mixed reaction since it first appeared on screens in 2004, presented by Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh and Anna Nolan. This was partly because it replaced the hugely popular show Open House. There was speculation that the show has not proved as successful as its predecessor and that it would not return for a second season. However, a second series began in 2005, although one of the former presenters, Sheana Keane, did not return.

The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. In 1977, due to an advertiser's liquidity problem, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.

A native of New York, Paxson began his career as an owner of WACK Radio, a little 500 watt radio station in the village of Newark, New York. His next attempt at media ownership was TV station WNYP (channel 26) in Jamestown, New York; Paxson, who bought the station in 1966, attempted to affiliate the station with the CTV Television Network out of Canada (a first for an American television station); by 1969, the station had failed. Paxson later emerged as the owner of a small AM radio station, WWQT 1470 AM, in Clearwater, Florida. There, in 1977, an advertiser had plenty of product to sell—avocado-green-colored can openers—but ran out of funds to purchase airtime. Paxson instructed talk-show host Bob Circosta, who had a talk show from noon until 3:00 PM, to sell the can openers live over the airwaves, and both men were stunned at the audience response. All 112 can openers were purchased within the hour on August 28, 1977. This started the Suncoast International Bargainers Club.

Sensing the sales potential of live, on-air product selling, Paxson and financier Roy Speer co-founded a local cable TV channel (channel 52 on Vision Cable) in 1982 that sold products directly to Florida viewers, and then launched nationwide in 1985. The channel was the Home Shopping Club, later Home Shopping Network, and Paxson's former radio man Bob Circosta was tapped as the network's first-ever host. HSN soon became a billion dollar juggernaut and began the home shopping / electronic retailing industry. In 1996, the two sold HSN to Hollywood executive Barry Diller.

The home shopping/electronic retailing industry was created in 1977, when small market talk radio show host Bob Circosta was asked to sell avocado-green-colored can openers live on the air by station owner Bud Paxson, when an advertiser traded 112 units of product instead of paying his advertising bill. Hesitant at first, Circosta reluctantly obliged – and to both men's great surprise, all 112 can openers sold out within the hour. Paxson sensed the vast sales potential of home-based commerce, and founded the world's first shopping channel on cable television, later launching nationwide with the Home Shopping Network (rebranded as HSN).

The home shopping/electronic retailing industry was created in 1977, when small market talk radio show host Bob Circosta was asked to sell avocado-green-colored can openers live on the air by station owner Bud Paxson, when an advertiser traded 112 units of product instead of paying his advertising bill. Hesitant at first, Circosta reluctantly obliged – and to both men's great surprise, all 112 can openers sold out within the hour. Paxson sensed the vast sales potential of home-based commerce, and founded the world's first shopping channel on cable television, later launching nationwide with the Home Shopping Network (rebranded as HSN). Bob Circosta was America's first ever TV home shopping host,becoming one of the most instantly recognizable salesmen in the Free World. Over the next three decades, Circosta sold over 75,000 different products on HSN, netted over 20,000 hours of live, on-air TV selling, and achieved personal product sales in excess of one billion dollars. The classic television-based home shopping industry quickly became a major player in the retail industry. The two most successful shopping channels – HSN and QVC – generate a combined total of over 10 billion dollars in sales every year.

Ask This Old House began in 2002 and was spun off from a section of This Old House Magazine of the same name. Readers of the magazine or viewers of the show submit questions about various home repair or improvement projects, which are answered by the experts. It has been nominated for 5 Emmy Awards. The regulars on the show are O'Connor, Tom Silva, Richard Trethewey and Roger Cook. (This Old House veteran Norm Abram does not appear on Ask This Old House due to numerous other commitments on Abram's part, notably his involvement in The New Yankee Workshop.) Guest experts appear to answer more specialized questions. The show takes place in "the loft" of a rural barn somewhere in the Boston area. Most of the questions are answered in the loft, but one or two homeowners in each episode receive a visit from one of the show's three tradesmen (or a guest tradesman if the project is not construction, plumbing/heating or landscaping related such as electrical or painting projects), who assist in either starting or completing the task with the homeowners' help. O'Connor sometimes assists in these projects. There is also a feature entitled "What Is It?" in which three of the four regulars try to guess what an unusual tool is used for. The adjudicating fourth regular reveals the actual use. Beginning with the 2007/08 season, this program added a "useful tip" segment provided by a viewer of the show. The useful tip segment is a revival of a short-lived feature of This Old House when Vila hosted the show.

The dance hall where people were invited to dance which the show used was the MuchMusic studios on the main floor of the CHUM-City Building in Toronto, but audiences often spilled out onto Queen Street West, and on warm days the windows to the studio were opened, with some acts performing outside. It was also not uncommon for dancers to be stationed on the CHUM-City rooftop or even on rooftops of buildings across the street, effectively making the surrounding neighbourhood part of the set. Most music played was pre-recorded but live acts also were invited on some shows, and in the 1990s guest deejays were also featured. The show was hosted by Monika Deol until 1996, along with Michael Williams, followed by George Lagogianes, and also featured dancing floor director MC Craig F. (Craig Halket of Combat Des Clips on MuchMusic.) After that, a rotation of various hosts took over. The show was an hour and a half, until 2001, when it shortened to just an hour long. Two concerts were hosted annually. One at Canada's Wonderland, during the summer and another in the winter, at Winterlude in Ottawa.

A native of Toronto, Jensen was raised in a tiny Quebecan mining town (Rouyn-Noranda) and played several sports including baseball, hockey, and football. He attributed his interest in sports psychology to his youth when he "had a very excitable personality, and learned that my excitability got in the way of performing at my best in certain situations". Jensen has worked as a sports psychologist for the Canadian Olympics team. In a 2010 article for CBC Sports, journalist Nancy Wilson wrote that Jensen had helped Olympians for over 20 years, noting that the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games marked the seventh Olympics he was involved in. Since the 1984 Olympics, he has assisted his country's athletes at each subsequent Olympics.

Kimball remained at the post for only 11 months, when he was replaced by Richard L. Evans, who continued in that capacity until his death in 1971. J.

WYOU remained a solid runner-up to WNEP through the early 1990s. However, after Nexstar began the JSA with WBRE, channel 22's ratings plummeted, and would never recover, since WBRE was always favored before WYOU. Some have referred to WYOU as the "ugly step-sister" due to Nexstar's perceived unwillingness to invest in channel 22's news department. Even luring away another former popular WNEP anchorman, Frank Andrews, did not help the cause. He left the station in March 2006 to make a successful bid for a seat in the state house where he served under his real name, Frank Andrews Shimkus.

For sixteen years starting in 1970, Roger Grimsby and Bill Beutel were the faces of Eyewitness News. Grimsby came to channel 7 in 1968 from KGO-TV, and was the station's lead anchor when Eyewitness News was introduced. He was known for his opening tagline, "Good Evening, I'm Roger Grimsby, here now the news", and his closing line, "Hoping your news is good news, I'm Roger Grimsby." Beutel had previously anchored at channel 7 from 1962 to 1968 (shortly before ABC moved Grimsby to New York City) before spending two years as the network's London bureau chief. The duo were split up for the first ten months of 1975, as ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show AM America. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's Bill Bonds and veteran Boston anchor Tom Ellis to help replace Beutel; both Bonds and Ellis co-anchored at 11 p.m. for a time. When AM America was cancelled and replaced with Good Morning America, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6 p.m. and Bonds returned to Detroit. Ellis remained until 1977 and was replaced by Larry Kane, who lasted only one year as sole 11 p.m. anchor. Kane's successor, Ernie Anastos, began his New York career at the station; he co-anchored at 11 p.m. for his entire 12-year tenure there.

WNYW was the first television station to cover the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center that occurred on September 11, 2001. The station interrupted a commercial break at 8:48 a.m. ET to deliver the first public report of the attacks on air by anchor Jim Ryan and reporter Dick Oliver. In 2002, WNYW brought early evening newscasts back to the station with the launch of a 90-minute weekday news block from 5-6:30 p.m. In 2004, longtime anchor John Roland, a 35-year veteran of channel 5, retired from the station on June 4, 2004; former NBC News correspondent Len Cannon, who joined WNYW as a reporter and anchor some time earlier, was initially named as Roland's replacement. Several months later, veteran New York City anchorman Ernie Anastos (who at the time was anchoring at WCBS-TV) signed a multi-year contract with WNYW, displacing Cannon as lead anchor; Cannon asked for, and was granted, a release from his contract with the station shortly after Anastos's contract deal was announced. Anastos joined WNYW in July 2005, and Cannon joined KHOU-TV in Houston as its lead anchor in the spring of 2006. On April 3, 2006, WNYW debuted a new set, theme music and graphics package, and introduced a new logo based on the on-air look first adopted by Tampa sister station WTVT that became standard for all of Fox's owned-and-operated stations.

On May 27, 2004, Doctor fired popular sports anchor Warner Wolf, three months before his contract expired, without giving Wolf a chance to say goodbye on air. This incident was widely panned by several newspapers, including the New York Daily News, and the move alienated and angered many viewers. Wolf was replaced by the much younger Chris Wragge, who was brought in from NBC affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston. On June 1, 2005, Jim Rosenfield rejoined the station to anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts with Roz Abrams, who joined channel 2 the previous year after an 18-year run at WABC-TV. The son of a former CBS executive, Rosenfield previously worked at the station from 1998 to 2000 before moving to WNBC (to anchor Live at Five) after a contract dispute with channel 2. Rosenfield replaced Ernie Anastos, who moved to WNYW in July 2000.	Rosenfield replaced Ernie Anastos, who moved to WNYW in July 2000.	/m/06brgl	Ernie_Anastos	20	33	/people/person,/tv/tv_personality
He left WCBS in April 2000 after a contract dispute and joined rival station WNBC-TV, where he co-anchored the 5pm newscast ("Live at Five") with Sue Simmons. He left WNBC in 2005, and returned to WCBS in June of that year to replace Ernie Anastos, who in turn left WCBS for a 5-year $10 million contract at WNYW-TV. He was one of the hirings of Dianne Doctor, who had been his previous boss at WNBC.

Abrams then joined WCBS-TV as the co-anchor of "CBS2 News" at 5 and 11 p.m. on April 19, 2004. First she was paired with veteran New York news anchor Ernie Anastos, who had co-anchored WABC Eyewitness News with her in the 1980s, and then with Jim Rosenfield. In April 2006, she was moved from 11 p.m. to noon, co-anchoring with Mary Calvi. Abrams was replaced at 11 p.m. with veteran Dana Tyler. In November 2006, however, Abrams left the air after WCBS-TV sports anchor Chris Wragge and newly-hired Kristine Johnson (formerly of NBC News and MSNBC) became the anchors at 5 and 11 p.m. According to the New York Post, Ms. Abrams was last reported as "currently sitting out her contract - and collecting what's believed to be roughly $6 million that's due to her."

Referring to the difficulties of having a family and career, she said at the time: "Anchoring is fun. At one time I wanted to be a network reporter, but now I think that is too difficult a life. One of these days I want to have a baby." In 1981, she moved to WABC-TV in New York City. Within two years, she became co-anchor of the station's 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, first with co-host Tom Snyder from 1983 to 1984 and with Ernie Anastos until 1986.

The reformed Grimsby-Beutel team kept Eyewitness News on top of the ratings through the middle 1980s, when it briefly fell to last place. Though the ratings drop was mostly associated with ABC-TV's poor primetime performance during that time, it led to Grimsby's firing in 1986. However, within a year, WABC-TV had shot back to first place and has been the ratings leader in New York ever since. After Grimsby's firing, Beutel was joined at 6:00 p.m. by Kaity Tong and John Johnson in a rotating anchor arrangement. After the arrangement came to an end Beutel began a long stint anchoring the 6 p.m. news alone, which ended when his 11 p.m. co-anchor Diana Williams joined him in 1998. Beutel returned to the 11 p.m. Eyewitness News in 1989 after Ernie Anastos left to join WCBS and was originally paired with then-longtime co-anchor Kaity Tong. After Tong left WABC in 1991 Beutel anchored with Susan Roesgen for one year, but the pairing was unsuccessful and in 1992 Roesgen was replaced by Diana Williams.

The show is a fly-on-the-wall series following a handful of passengers and staff based at the airport, who work for the airlines, BAA, (the airport operator), the animal reception centre, which handles all animals arriving and departing through the airport, the ambulance, fire and police services serving the airport, customs and immigration, resident press and others. The airlines and staff featured tend to change from series to series. However, certain staff feature in multiple series. The first series of Airport aired on BBC Two in 1996. Originally intended to be a low-key behind-the-scenes documentary, the emergence of several memorable recurring characters gave the show a docusoap feel. As a result the series was transferred to a primetime BBC One slot the following year. Special fame was gained by Jeremy Spake, an Aeroflot employee, whose flamboyance earned him a series of short 'bumpers' on UKTV People explaining how to best use airports. Other airlines featured throughout the series are Avianca, Aer Lingus, BMI, Canadian Airlines, Cyprus Airways, Czech Airlines, El Al, Emirates Airline, Gulf Air, Icelandair, Iran Air, Jat Airways, Kuwait Airways, Pakistan International, Qantas, Qatar Airways and Virgin Atlantic.

The original version was broadcast during the late 1970s to late 1980s on the ABC on Sunday mornings. It was normally hosted by Drew Morphett with a panel consisting of former players and pundits. Two matches from the previous day's Victorian Football League (VFL) fixtures would be screened and the panel would speculate about the games along with the league ladder and the goal, mark and play of the day. The format of the show was comprehensive, yet devoted mainly to matters on the field. Today it appears simplistic when compared with modern football's more saturated and market driven media coverage.

Vampiro and Raven would grow to be bitter rivals which resulted in a backstage brawl which Vampiro ended up with a torn "ACL." While in TNA, he formed a stable known as The Gathering, which included ROH rival CM Punk, as well as Julio Dinero and Alexis Laree, though they would later turn on him. He created matches involving old friends and brought in former work colleagues from ECW such as New Jack, Perry Saturn, Mikey Whipwreck, and Justin Credible, all of whom Raven beat in matches. Later in the year these superstars overturned Sports Entertainment Xtreme (SEX). In 2003, Raven feuded with James Mitchell and the Disciples of the New Church. Raven took them all out one by one just like he said, but with interferences from The Gathering and ECW counterparts. Raven ended his feud with James Mitchell in a Last Man Standing match, which was won by Raven. This led to a long undefeated run and the beginning of Raven's attempts to fulfill his destiny. In 2004, Raven teamed up with The Sandman to go against The Gathering. The Gathering won due to interference from James Mitchell, who had aligned himself with The Gathering.

Cage had his first title defense against Brown on March 12, 2006 at TNA's Destination X PPV event; there Cage defeated Brown to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the March 25 and April 2 respective Impact! episodes, Abyss, his manager Father James Mitchell, and Alex Shelley showed two pre-taped video packages that had been complied in the weeks before the episodes. The first, on March 25, depicted Mitchell stalking Cage's wife Denise, confronting her, and even threatening that "they were coming". The second aired on April 2, with Abyss, accompanied by Mitchell and Shelley, who was taping the segment with a camcorder like the previous video package, attacking Cage at his home in Tampa, Florida and nearly drowning Cage in his own pool. This storyline led to Cage facing Abyss at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 23, 2006 in a Six Sides of Steel cage match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, with Cage prevailing. After the match, Cage attempted to attack Mitchell and gain revenge for all his recent evil deeds against Cage and his family. Abyss, however, stopped him, took a steel chain, wrapped it around Cage's neck, and attempted to hang him with it until he passed out. Abyss and Mitchell then stole the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and left the arena. The storyline between Abyss and Mitchell and Cage continued until TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 14, 2006, where Cage defeated Abyss and regained the NWA Title belt under Full Metal Mayhem rules.	episodes, Abyss, his manager Father James Mitchell, and Alex Shelley showed two pre-taped video packages that had been complied in the weeks before the episodes.	/m/068yhy	James_Mitchell_(manager)	29	50	/base/wrestling/professional_wrestling_manager,/film/person_or_entity_appearing_in_film,/people/person,/tv/tv_personality
He lost the title to "The Monster" Abyss at Genesis by disqualification after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into a stack of tables covered in barbed wire. In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued as he tried to get in Abyss' head by telling him he was being used by his satanic manager James Mitchell. Abyss was visibly affected by this, but remained by Mitchell's side. Sting's former friend Christian Cage and his bodyguard Tomko were also thrown in the mix, with Cage claiming he knew a dark secret in Abyss' past. The three finally met in a Three Way match for the NWA World Heavyweight title at Turning Point, with Abyss retaining the title. After Turning Point, Sting continued to try to convince Abyss he was nothing but a machine for Mitchell, and he got so far into Abyss that Abyss grabbed Mitchell by the throat, almost chokeslamming him on an edition of Impact!, but ultimately convinced himself not to.

When Raven joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, he formed a new version of the Flock, this time calling them The Gathering. The original Gathering members were Julio Dinero and Alexis Laree, with CM Punk joining the group soon after its inception. Punk and Dinero played 'adoring Raven fanboy' gimmicks, making Raven the main focus of the group. Alexis left both the group and TNA after being signed to a contract by WWE. On December 7, 2003, Punk and Dinero turned on Raven during a six-man steel cage match. Raven disappeared from TNA, while Punk and Dinero joined up with longtime Raven-enemy James Mitchell and continued to wrestle under the Gathering tag team name.

Shortly before a TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a physical scuffle with Teddy Hart outside of a restaurant that was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed three unplanned spots putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around the time of the scuffle, Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows, leading to speculation he was fired for the incident. Punk, however, has stated that the scuffle had no bearing on his TNA career. He said the reason he and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA pay-per-views was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not connected with the fans as villains, having turned against the popular Raven and instead formed a villainous tag team managed by James Mitchell. The officials decided that as the teams as villains was not working decided to put the storyline on hold indefinitely, and thus had no work for Punk or Dinero. Punk officially quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.

TCN-9, the first Australian television station to regularly screen programmes in colour, launched on 16 September 1956. John Godson introduced the station and Bruce Gyngell presented the first programme, This Is Teleevision (so becoming the first person to appear on Australian television). Later that year, GTV-9 in Melbourne commenced transmissions to broadcast the 1956 Summer Olympics, later forming the National Television Network alongside QTQ-9 in Brisbane in 1959 and NWS-9 in Adelaide, the basis of the current Nine Network, in 1959. Before its formation, TCN-9 was then affiliated with HSV-7 (due to the fact that they were both Australia's first television stations, having been opened in 1956), and GTV-9's sister affiliate was ATN-7. By the late 1960s, the network had begun unofficially calling itself "the National Nine Network," and became simply the Nine Network in the early 1980s.

In the mid-1980s, Yorkshire broke from the network by refusing to screen the BAFTA Awards, claiming them to be slaps on the backs of the BBC. The movie The Sting was a replacement in 1986. As the rest of the network overran in the live BAFTA screening, Yorkshire had to cobble together minor programmes until other regions were able to screen the late-running ITN News. In the 1990s, while Bruce Gyngell was managing director, Yorkshire declined to show The Good Sex Guide, replacing the programme with Alan Whicker repeats.

Bruce Gyngell, the former chairman of breakfast station TV-am, became YTTV's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting "a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region", in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV, and "3" was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, "Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and we want it to be known that we are part of this great region and moving with it." Tyne Tees acquired the brand "Channel 3 North East", with 'Tyne Tees Television' still being retained as the company name.

In 1984 Australian business tycoon Kerry Packer took a substantial minority interest in the company, and in May appointed his own Chief Executive, Bruce Gyngell, who had run Australian networks and previously worked in the UK for ATV in the 1970s, and later ran Yorkshire Television. Greg Dyke left to take a new position with TVS, but Gyngell pursued the same lightweight, populist approach that Dyke had forged to establish the station's viability, a model parodied later in a Guardian newspaper headline as 'Snap, Crackle and Pap'.

Margaret Thatcher, whose government had introduced the change to the allocation of commercial television franchises (but who had by then been replaced as Prime Minister by John Major), famously wrote to Bruce Gyngell, apologising for being partly responsible for the loss of the TV-am's licence. It read, in part: "I am ... heartbroken. I am only too painfully aware that I was responsible for the legislation." The letter was private but Gyngell made it public, which drew criticism from friends of the former Prime Minister.

Mainstream professional television was launched on 16 September 1956 in Sydney. The new medium was introduced by Bruce Gyngell with the words 'Good evening, and welcome to television', and has since seen the introduction of colour, and digital television, and the planned shutdown of analogue broadcasts set to take place between 2010 to 2013 (depending on the area).

The first words spoken on the station were by John Godson, who introduced the station audio-only, shortly before the first program, This Is Television, was introduced by Bruce Gyngell. As Godson's voice only was heard, Gyngell (who spoke and was seen) is regarded as the first person to "appear" on Australian television. Original footage of Gyngell's opening address is not believed to exist, with the oft-screened "opening" footage being re-created in 1959 for archival purposes. Other early programming included the 1958 variety music program Bandstand which was launched by Brian Henderson. It lasted for 14 years on the station and launched the careers of many Australian performers.

Having moved to Sydney, Tony continued to pursue his dreams at numerous Hotel talent quests, a regular role as resident compere and vocalist at the Spellsons nitery in Pitt St. This was in addition to holding down a regular job as an advertising executive, where at one point he cast himself as the “Cambridge Whistler”, a central character in a 1960's cigarette commercial which brought him under national scrutiny. It was at this point that then head of the Seven Network Bruce Gyngell spotted Barber and was understood to have liked what he saw, and immediately suggested that he host a Grundy show.

The origin of Festival was Mainguard's purchase and merging of two small Sydney businesses—a record pressing company, Microgroove Australia, one of the first Australian companies to produce discs in the new vinyl microgroove record format, and Casper Precision Engineering. After buying the two companies Cullen re-incorporated them as Festival Records on 21 October 1952; soon after he appointed popular Sydney bandleader Les Welch as the label's first artists and repertoire (A&R) manager. Another early staff member was Bruce Gyngell, who was later hired to help found Australia's first commercial TV station, TCN-9 in Sydney and was the first person to appear on TV in Australia in 1956.

Claude Boulard (died 7 June 2003) was a radio and television personality. He was the founder of the radio station CIMO-FM in Magog, which he sold to Radiomutuel in 1986. He also helped promote JoJo Savard, a television astrologist who attracted national media notoriety in the 1990s. Boulard's links to Savard became an issue in the 1997 campaign; Pierre Foglia of La Presse described him as a "king of fools" who should not have been allowed to run for a credible political party. Boulard defended his work as a professional host and said there was nothing illegal about Savard's business. He received 12,770 votes (28.09%), finishing second against Liberal Party incumbent Denis Paradis.

Ventura then stated that he had no respect for Dick Cheney because he is "a guy who got five deferments from the Vietnam War. Clearly, he's a coward. He wouldn't go when it was his time to go. And now he is a chickenhawk. Now he is this big tough guy who wants this hardcore policy. And he's the guy that sanctioned all this torture by calling it 'enhanced interrogation'." Ventura also expressed interest in being appointed ambassador to Cuba should U.S. relations with Cuba continue to improve. On a May 18, 2009, appearance on The View, Ventura asked Elisabeth Hasselbeck if waterboarding is acceptable, why were the Oklahoma City bombers, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, not waterboarded. "We only seem to waterboard Muslims." Comparing the waterboarding of detainees to the North Vietnamese torture of American P.O.W.s, Ventura asserted, "We created our own Hanoi Hilton in Guantánamo. That's our Hanoi Hilton." "'Enhanced interrogation' is Dick Cheney changing a word. Dick Cheney comes up with a new word to cover his ass." On May 20, 2009, Ventura appeared on Fox & Friends. When Brian Kilmeade told Ventura that he would stop supporting waterboarding when "they're dead", Ventura responded, "Really? Have you enlisted? Have you enlisted or are you just talking?... Go walk the walk, don't talk the talk."

After Jeopardy, he succeeded John Burgess as host of Wheel of Fortune (Seven Network) in July 1996 following the show's relocation from Adelaide to Sydney as part of an attempted revamp. He began his tenure amid much controversy and dealing with the fact that viewers did not appreciate that Burgess was not given a chance to say his goodbyes on air. While the show retained many of its well-known sounds, a new format along with new theme music, new graphics and a new set was made for the show. As a result the ratings quickly declined affecting ratings for Seven News and Today Tonight. As part of an attempt to win viewers back, the theme music that had been introduced the previous year was reinstated, the new set underwent minor changes and the former prize shop was reincarnated to an extent - contestants upon solving a puzzle were offered three prizes and one had to be selected. By the end of 1996, Barber was removed from the position of host by the Seven Network after the show was in a position where it was nearly cancelled. Alongside this, co-host Adriana Xenides (who until this time had not missed an episode during the Wheel's tenure) as a result of the public backlash began to suffer from depression and what she called a physical breakdown in November 1996. She would remain on leave from the show until July 1997. Barber appeared at the beginning of the 1997 series premiere to hand the show over to Rob Elliott. Former Perfect Match hostess Kerrie Friend would fill in for Xenides until July of that year.

After moving from Argentina to Adelaide in her teens, Xenides gained a career as a model and was a finalist in the first Mrs South Australia contest in 1978. After being approached by Grundy Television, Xenides joined Ernie Sigley as co-host of Australia's version of Wheel of Fortune in 1981. She remained on the show for 18 years, working with Ernie Sigley, John Burgess (between 1984 and 1996), Tony Barber (1996) and Rob Elliott, and for 16 of those years – from 1981 to 1996 – she never missed an episode. Xenides formally departed the show in 1999, and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest running game show host.

Among his on-air trademarks on the show include his deadpan greetings to guest callers and his audience such as "Greetings! Salutations!", his constant use of rich vocabulary to describe things (referring to sportswriters as "ink-stained wretches"), his dry wit (which includes using such quips as "Who gives a flying fadoo?!", "Kicking ass, taking names", "Raising a Spockian eyebrow", "giddyup" and "Bite me!", referencing the fictional hockey players Claude and Orest Themalfachuk, and likening someone who is impatient to "Sonic the Hedgehog, tapping his foot"), and a pair of sunglasses he wears during the television simulcasts of Prime Time Sports. McCown is often indifferent about the fact that his radio show is simulcast on television, often saying during his introductions "also simulcast on Rogers Sportsnet for those of you who do not own radios" or "simulcast on Rogers Sportsnet in lieu of other programming". He has on many occasions maintained his stance against fighting in hockey (especially staged fights), hits to the head, and a strong aversion for the sport of soccer..

On June 4, 2004, nearly a year after the death of Cuban-American salsa singer Celia Cruz (who lived in nearby Fort Lee), Union City heralded its annual Cuban Day Parade by dedicating its new Celia Cruz Park (also known as Celia Cruz Plaza) at 31st Street and Bergenline Avenue, with Cruz's widower, Pedro Knight, present. The park featured a sidewalk star in Cruz's honor, and an 8' x 10' mural by Union City's Edgardo Davila, a collage of Cruz's career throughout the decades. There are four other similar dedications to Cruz around the world. The Latin American Kiwanis Club refurbished the park in early June 2006, replacing the mural with a backlit photograph of Cruz. Cruz's star has expanded into Union City's "Walk of Fame", as new marble stars are added each spring to honor Latin entertainment and media personalities. People so honored at the park include merengue singer Joseíto Mateo, salsa singer La India, Cuban musician Israel "Cachao" Lopez, Cuban tenor Beny Moré, Tito Puente, Spanish language television news anchor Rafael Pineda, salsa pioneer Johnny Pacheco, singer/bandleader Gilberto Santa Rosa and music promoter Ralph Mercado.

Scarborough joined WNBC-TV in March 1974 as sole anchor of its then-new 5:00 PM newscast, NewsCenter 4 (later renamed News 4 New York). Eventually, he became the station's lead anchor at 6:00 and 11:00 pm. In 2003, Scarborough became the unofficial "dean" of New York-area television news anchors when WABC-TV anchor Bill Beutel retired after 37 years. Eight years later, Scarborough surpassed Beutel as the longest-serving English-language news anchor in New York television history. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the anchor desk is second in New York-area television only to Spanish-language WXTV's Rafael Pineda, who started with his station in 1972. For much of his first 20 years with NBC, Scarborough occasionally appeared on NBC News and often anchored the network's prime-time news updates.

By the end of the 1930s Moore was so well known as an accompanist that Myra Hess invited him to give a talk about his profession at one of her of lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery. The pianist Joseph Cooper wrote of this, and later similar talks, "He revealed a sense of verbal timing of which any professional comic would be proud. His unique blend of wit and wisdom not only pleased the cognoscenti but also won over ordinary people who had no idea that classical music could be fun."

Each week there would be a special guest, who would also have to answer questions -- with the focus being on topics that related to the guest's life and career, so as to lead to amusing anecdotes. The questions to the panel were asked in a series of rounds, each with a theme, such as "The Face, The Music", where each member of the panel would have to identify a composer from their picture, as well as decide whether the music played along with it was by that composer or some other.

Christian was born in Charles City, Virginia in 1947. He began his broadcasting career at WWBT in Richmond, Virginia as a news reporter, covering state and local politics, the public school system, and landmark cases in the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals. His first stint as a weatherman came in 1975, in Baltimore, Maryland, when he was hired by news director Ron Kershaw at WBAL-TV to join the Action News team which included Sue Simmons, Mike Hambrick, Ron Smith, Curt Anderson and Joe Krebs. In Baltimore, Christian quickly gained a respectable following because of his quick wit and not so dry humor. Additionally, he frequently made appearances at many community and charitable events held at shopping centers, elementary schools and little leagues. Christian was in Baltimore at the same time that Oprah was at Baltimore's WJZ-TV.

Educator and author John Goodlad, a student-teacher at the school in the 1940s, wrote that it was "a joy" to work there. Edwin Cohan, the teacher with whom Goodlad was assigned to work, and Stanley Morrison, the principal, "almost raucous in their bantering of one another", Goodlad wrote. They "set a tone of caring and civility that permeated the whole school, affecting adults and children alike.

However, a plena standard to this day was born when seamstresses of a local handkerchief factory striked against the factory's owner, Lebanese industrialist William Mamary, and Mamery hired replacement workers (whom the seamstresses considered to be scabs). Don Mon wrote "Aló, ¿Quién Ñama" (loosely translated as "Hello, Who' Calling?", sometimes referred to as "Qué Será") as a musical description of the strike. Since the seamstress' strike was organized by local labor leader John Vidal, and patronized by local assemblywoman María Luisa Arcelay, they are mentioned in the song. The seamstresses are reportedly calling each other as to raise mutual concern about the poor pay they're getting. Near the end, Don Mon breaks into what his son later called "trabalenguas" (tongue twisters), which in fact is a style of scat singing where some of the syllables of the actual song are slurred nasally and delivered quickly along with the scatting. The skill was passed from father to son; Efraín became so adept at using "trabalenguas" that he eventually was called "El Rey del Trabalengua" ("The Tongue Twister King") once he became famous.

Efraín was trained as a multi-instrumentalist: he played timbales, congas, bongos, saxophone, trumpet, trombone and bass guitar. In his beginnings as a musician, Efraín and Germán Vélez (later the father of Wilkins Vélez) formed "El Dúo Huasteco", and sang Mexican folk songs that were popular in Latin America at the time (they even dressed the part). Santos Colon joined the duo occasionally and made it a trio. Their talent moved Gilbert Mamery (who also happened to be William's son; Gilbert legally changed the family name's spelling to prevent mispronunciations) to feature them as part of musical reviews staged at Mayagüez's San José Theater. Later, Mon became a percussionist and singer with various local bands, working with bandleaders Juan Ramón Delgado, better known as "Moncho Leña" and William Manzano, both of whom he persuaded to allow him to arrange some of his father's plenas for a full orchestra. A full orchestral version of "Aló, ¿Quién Ñama?" was a sleeper hit in 1954.

In November 2004, VH1 screened a Backstage Pass Special episode of Bands Reunited showing host Aamer Haleem trying and failing to corner Morrissey before a show at the Apollo Theater. In March 2006, Morrissey revealed that The Smiths had been offered $5 million for a performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which he turned down, saying, "No, because money doesn't come into it." He further explained, "It was a fantastic journey. And then it ended. I didn't feel we should have ended. I wanted to continue.  wanted to end it. And that was that."

Marr and Morrissey have repeatedly stated they will not reunite the band. In 2005, VH1 attempted to get the band back together on its Bands Reunited show but abandoned its attempt after the show's host, Aamer Haleem, failed to corner Morrissey before a show. In December 2005 it was announced that Johnny Marr and the Healers would play at Manchester v Cancer, a benefit show for cancer research being organised by Andy Rourke and his production company, Great Northern Productions. Rumours suggested that a Smiths reunion would occur at this concert but were dispelled by Johnny Marr on his website.

By the time he was a teenager, he had built almost 90 puppets, which he based upon commercials, popular music, and his friends. While still in high school, Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore, including schools, churches, fundraisers, and community events. While appearing at a neighborhood festival, Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr, who became Clash's first mentor and hired him to perform in the children's show Caboose at Channel 2. Clash also built puppets for the Romper Room franchise. When he was 17, he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love, who became Clash's mentor, after seeing Love featured in an episode of the documentary Call It Macaroni. In 1979, on Love's recommendation, Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the Sesame Street float during the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, and met Jim Henson, who later became his boss, mentor, and friend.

For the program's first 25 years, weather reports were delivered by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway drew the day's weather fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show went to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement in 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties. When Floyd Kalber became news anchor in 1976, Wood continued to do the weather (in addition to doing other news, sports, and commercials) until 1978. The weather is reported every half-hour during the program's first three hours, though since Al Roker took over as weather reporter, this is not always the case as he may conduct an interview in place of the national weather forecast at least once during the show, leaving only the local weather inserts by NBC stations. Today weather reporters have included Bob Ryan (1978–1980); Willard Scott (1980–1996) and Al Roker (1996–present). Until Ryan's hiring, no one on the show had practical experience or academic credentials in meteorology. Since NBC's purchase of The Weather Channel in 2008, personnel from that network frequently participate in Today forecast segments, at the site of a weather event or from their suburban Atlanta headquarters.

Gould's approach to the sport has been that of passionate supporter, constantly learning from and bouncing opinions off his co-presenters on the five TV show. These included Todd Macklin, Josh Chetwynd (who later returned as the incumbent), David Lengel (who left for a job with mlb.com covering the New York Yankees) and Mike Carlson, the channel's regular NFL analyst. He made liberal use of catchphrases, such as "Greetings fellow baseball nuts!", and "It's the last chance saloon!" Gould is a fan of Chelsea F.C. and rarely missed an opportunity to use them as an analogy in his baseball presenting. He also included a section on the show regarding fantasy baseball. His nickname on five's Baseball coverage is Gouldfish, which refers to his 'goldfish-like' memory.

Sounders during that period teased listeners about how "a new station" would soon be coming to the 102.7 frequency, and it arrived in April, when WNEW became "102.7 Blink" (keeping the WNEW call letters) and adopted an unusual "Entertainment AC" format.

On The Hub's television game show Family Game Night hosted by Todd Newton, a segment called Operation Relay is played, where two families compete one after the other. Family members take turns pulling pieces out of an oversized Operation gameboard, and then running through an obstacle course to eventually place them in a container at the end of the course. If a player fails to pull a piece without touching the side, or drops it while going through the obstacle course, they must move to the back of the line, and it's the next person's turn. Each piece is worth a specific amount of points, and whichever team has earned the highest score when time expires wins. Also on the show is Operation Sam Dunk, in which families play skee ball to collect the most points possible. Each family gets two turns and the team with the highest score wins the game. For the show's third season, Operation is introduced, in which one family can win money for a shopping spree by removing pieces to earn up to four rolls and then play skee ball in a same manner as in Operation Sam Dunk.

In 1954 KOVR erected its television transmitter tower on the mountain. One of the workers involved in the project said that parts of the tower were trucked up to the summit and assembled there. Based in Stockton, the station eventually became affiliated with ABC and was known for its popular "Toonytown" program hosted by Art Finley. With the completion of the mammoth television tower near Walnut Grove, KOVR moved its transmitter there and later relocated its studios to Sacramento.

KOVR is Sacramento's oldest continuously-operating television station. It first hit the airwaves on September 6, 1954 from the California State Fair. Originally an independent station with a transmitter located on Mount Diablo, its signal reached the San Francisco Bay Area, hence the call letters KOVR ("covering" all of Northern California). It broadcast from a studio on Miner Avenue in Stockton. Art Finley hosted an afternoon children's program, Toonytown, for several years, before moving to San Francisco's KRON.

KRON-TV originally broadcast from studios located in the basement of the Chronicle building at Fifth and Mission streets. It originally maintained transmitter facilities on San Bruno Mountain; "NBC" lettering was placed near the summit of Radio Peak in huge white letters. In August 1959, the Chronicle reported that the tower was severely damaged by an unusually strong thunderstorm, requiring major repairs before KRON could return to the air. Newscasts benefited from the resources of the Chronicle and there was cooperation between KRON and the newspaper. In the 1950s and 1960s, local programs produced by KRON-TV included the award-winning documentary series Assignment Four, Fireman Frank with George Lamont and his puppets (including Scat the Cat and Karl the Karrot), and a live children's program hosted by Art Finley as Mayor Art. Bay area kids, known as the "City Council", joined Mayor Art in the studio each day. The show featured Popeye cartoons mixed with science demonstrations, a newsreel feature entitled "Mayor Art's Almanac", games, prizes, and a sock puppet named "Ring-A-Ding."

Tanya Byron, Stephen Briers, Rachel Morris and Laverne Antrobus became household names working on the British TV show Little Angels (which ran for three series), a docu-soap that follows the lives of families where the children have behavioural problems that are causing the parents difficulty. The show is seen as a 'life line' by the parents who are effectively calling professionals with years of experience of working with children and families to help them fix a problem that they believe beyond their ability to fix. Tanya Byron, Stephen Briers, Rachel Morris and Laverne Antrobus, monitor the behaviour of the family and the children before discussing with the parents the real underlying causes of the problem (which are nearly always in some way either caused by or contributed to by the parents themselves - usually by inadverently rewarding inappropriate behaviour with their attention). They then discuss a course of action with them and later they coach them in how to change their own and their children's behaviour to improve the situation (this is frequently done in scenes where the family is filmed doing something together with the parents receiving advice from the attending professional via an ear piece). The show is intended to be instructive to viewers in how to deal with common problems as well as of real help to the family being filmed (and of course entertaining).

The series, in the docu-soap genre, aimed to show parents how to overcome common behavioural problems in their children, using a team of experts who observed and gave advice. The format of each programme involved experts monitoring the behaviour of the family and the children, before discussing with the parents the real underlying causes of the problem, which frequently involved the parents themselves. The experts then discussed a course of action with the parents, later coaching them on how to change their own and their children's behaviour to improve the situation. This was frequently achieved in scenes where the family was filmed in a communal activity, with the parents receiving advice from the attending professional via an ear piece.

In the early 1960s, WNEW-TV produced children's shows such as Romper Room (until 1966, when it moved to WOR-TV), The Sandy Becker Show and The Sonny Fox Show, which was later known as Wonderama. Bob McAllister took over hosting Wonderama in 1967 and by 1970, Wonderama was syndicated to the other Metromedia stations. WNEW-TV also originated the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon in 1966, and broadcasted the program annually until 1986, when it moved to WWOR-TV, where it has aired ever since then. In the 1970s, local programming also included a weekly public affairs show hosted by Gabe Pressman, and Midday Live, a daily talk/information show hosted by Lee Leonard, and later by Bill Boggs. The station also carried movies, cartoons, off-network sitcoms and drama series and a primetime newscast at 10 p.m.	Bob McAllister took over hosting Wonderama in 1967 and by 1970, Wonderama was syndicated to the other Metromedia stations.	/m/08hhmx	Bob_McAllister	0	14	/people/deceased_person,/people/person,/tv/tv_personality
A year later, Fox hosted ABC's first original Saturday morning show, On Your Mark, a game show in which children ages 9 through 13 answered questions about various professions. On Your Mark lasted one season, but the lively Just For Fun lasted until 1965. Fox left Wonderama in 1967; his successor, Bob McAllister, continued the show both locally (in New York City), and in national syndication through the 1970s. Fox gradually withdrew from television work (he'd also played Mr. Prim in the 1966 film The Christmas That Almost Wasn't), spending time in theater and other entertainment while raising his own four children. He spent one year (1977) running children's programming for NBC (and taking one more stab at hosting, with the short-lived, California-based, Way Out Games in 1976), while spending time concurrently as a lecturer at the State University of New York at Stony Brook campus in the 1970s.

Bob McAllister had hosted a popular children's TV series, Wonderama, for over a decade when the series was taken off the air in 1977. As the host, McAllister sang the closing theme song Kids Are People Too. Shortly after that series was taken off the air, ABC offered him another series that tried to capitalize on Wonderama's 20 plus year record of children's entertainment by using the song's name as the new series name.

By 1971, there was little scope for cartoon writing in New York and Marks left for Los Angeles finding work for Hanna-Barbera. He worked on The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan (as Dennis Marx), Josie and the Pussycats and The Barkleys, the later of which he was joined by Kling, who had also written with Marks on both The Beatles and Batfink. Marks was on the verge of settling in Los Angeles, when a meeting with Bob McAllister led to a job producing the weekly children's show Wonderama. Wonderama was a long running show broadcast by Metromedia across five stations. Marks remained with the show for four years before switching to 'A.M. New York', a one-hour daily talk show. This lasted only two years, and by its end, Marks was again looking for work in cartoon screen writing. He headed back to Los Angeles, and got a short-term staff position at Hanna-Barbera. This was followed by a one-year contract with Filmation, writing for The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour.

TV Viisi's entertainment block was originally transmitted from 8 pm to 11 pm with The Voice covering the rest of the hours, but in the beginning of 2009 the hours were extended to five with programs starting at 6 pm. The changes in the schedule woke large amounts of hatred among the loyal viewers of The Voice, who found music videos a great alternative to the prime time line-ups of other channels. The viewership decreased drastically during the first year of the new arrangement, when over half of the viewers left. Journalist Tuomas Enbuske claimed in his show, "Incorrect, Tuomas Enbuske!", that "TV Viisi was the creation of a dumbed-down channel boss who has most likely spent his hole life digging his nose and eating all the snot that comes out". Even though he made a heavy attack against the channel, Enbuske later on went to present his own self-titled talk show on TV Viisi in 2012.

He then signed with the WWF and was pushed as a villainous character. Between 1980 and 1981, Slaughter wrestled in the WWF under the guidance of the Grand Wizard. He quickly rose to the status of number one contender on the strength of his "cobra clutch" challenges where he would seat wrestlers in a chair in the ring, and apply the hold, offering $5,000 to anyone who could break it. He would eventually face Bob Backlund for the World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Championship across the WWF territory in 1980, earning two-or-three main event matches in most markets. Slaughter was the only WWF-based challenger not to do the honors for Backlund at MSG (Backlund defeated him at the Meadowlands, but never in the Garden). Slaughter then engaged in a feud with Pat Patterson, which stemmed from Slaughter calling Patterson "yellow" and offering him $10,000 (double the usual amount) to try to break the cobra clutch. Patterson accepted on television and was escaping from the hold when Slaughter released it and put a beat-down on Patterson, starting a hot feud which culminated in an "Alley Fight" in New York, New York's Madison Square Garden between the two that is widely regarded as the best "hardcore" match of the Kayfabe era. In late 1981, Slaughter joined Mid Atlantic Wrestling and won the NWA United States Heavyweight Title and the NWA World Tag Team Titles with Don Kernodle. Upon returning to the WWF-again with the Grand Wizard as his manager- in 1983, Slaughter was a top contender to Bob Backlund's WWF Championship. However, his career took off after he turned face and defended America's honor against the hated Iron Sheik in 1984. Slaughter and the Iron Sheik engaged in many matches throughout 1984, culminating in a boot camp match which took place before a sold out Madison Square Garden that summer. However, with the emergence of Hulk Hogan as the WWF Champion and lead face within the company, Slaughter left for the AWA. On Vince McMahon's McMahon DVD, Slaughter said he was fired by McMahon in Toronto after no-showing an event in protest of McMahon's refusal to give him six weeks of paid vacation. Other interviews with Slaughter and McMahon have revealed that Slaughter left the company more over a dispute that emerged due to the WWF not allowing Slaughter's role in the G.I. Joe toy line. At the time of his departure Slaughter was easily the second biggest "face" in the company, surpassing Jimmy Snuka, and even André the Giant, with his popularity rivaling that of Hulk Hogan's.

He then signed with the WWF and was pushed as a villainous character. Between 1980 and 1981, Slaughter wrestled in the WWF under the guidance of the Grand Wizard. He quickly rose to the status of number one contender on the strength of his "cobra clutch" challenges where he would seat wrestlers in a chair in the ring, and apply the hold, offering $5,000 to anyone who could break it. He would eventually face Bob Backlund for the World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Championship across the WWF territory in 1980, earning two-or-three main event matches in most markets. Slaughter was the only WWF-based challenger not to do the honors for Backlund at MSG (Backlund defeated him at the Meadowlands, but never in the Garden). Slaughter then engaged in a feud with Pat Patterson, which stemmed from Slaughter calling Patterson "yellow" and offering him $10,000 (double the usual amount) to try to break the cobra clutch. Patterson accepted on television and was escaping from the hold when Slaughter released it and put a beat-down on Patterson, starting a hot feud which culminated in an "Alley Fight" in New York, New York's Madison Square Garden between the two that is widely regarded as the best "hardcore" match of the Kayfabe era.

When she was 21, Rippon began her television career at BBC South West in Plymouth in 1966, before becoming a reporter for BBC TV news. Rippon first presented a national news programme on BBC2 in 1974. For a fortnight, she replaced newsreader Richard Baker – who was on holiday – on BBC One's Nine O'Clock News, and was offered a permanent newsreading role on that programme in 1975. Rippon was called by newspapers the first female television newsreader. However, ITN's Barbara Mandell predated her, having first appeared on the second night of ITV in 1955, Nan Winton was the first female BBC newsreader in 1960, and Mary Marquis had already been BBC Scotland's main newsreader for a few years.

Starting in the early 1990s, CHAN harboured ambitions of producing an early-evening national newscast from its studios. In fact, several newscast pilots were produced at CHAN, suggesting the network was seriously considering such a move. However, that newscast never materialized; instead, CHAN began producing Canada Tonight, which aired on most WIC-owned stations beginning in 1993. Two versions were produced: one for BC itself, hosted by CKNW radio commentator Bill Good (who later went to CIVT-TV, CTV's current Vancouver O&O station, and retired in December 2010) and a national version, hosted by Tony Parsons, who also presented CHAN's nightly news program, the News Hour. When Canwest purchased CHAN, the stories that were once sourced from CTV's other affiliates throughout the country were replaced by stories sourced from Global's affiliates.	Two versions were produced: one for BC itself, hosted by CKNW radio commentator Bill Good (who later went to CIVT-TV, CTV's current Vancouver O&O station, and retired in December 2010) and a national version, hosted by Tony Parsons, who also presented CHAN's nightly news program, the News Hour.	/m/0bkq4n	Bill_Good	80	89	/people/person,/tv/tv_personality
Parsons advanced to the late evening anchor at CFTO until 1975, when he jumped at the opportunity to fill the 6:00 anchor spot on CHAN-TV (better known as BCTV) in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he remained for more than 30 years. He was also the anchor of the national edition of Canada Tonight, a CHAN-produced newscast which aired outside of BC on stations owned by Western International Communications until that company was acquired by the Global Television Network.

The channel will return exclusively on Foxtel and its broadcasting partners, under the proposed new name of Fox Sports AFL, which was later changed back to its original name Fox Footy.

Glenn was drafted in the first round (seventh overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. Glenn immediately made a big impact for New England, recording 90 receptions for 1,132 yards and 6 touchdowns in his rookie season, and helping his team reach Super Bowl XXXI. At the time, his 90 receptions were the most ever in a single season by a rookie in NFL history. Current San Francisco 49ers receiver Anquan Boldin caught 101 passes his rookie year during the 2003 NFL Season for the Arizona Cardinals. Patriots head coach, Bill Parcells, once referred to Glenn as "she", but after the 1996 season said he was wrong and Glenn was a winner. However, Parcells left New England after Glenn's rookie season and the talented wide receiver went into a four-year stretch of personal difficulties and inconsistent play. During the 2001 season, coach Bill Belichick deactivated him for the rest of the season because of series off-the-field problems - an interview on WBZ-TV in which Glenn hinted he was faking injuries because of Patriots discipline ("I'm bothered by a hamstring right now and I'm not getting paid. You do the math," he told a stunned Steve Burton) was a particular issue - and when the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI, Glenn did not receive a championship ring with his teammates; instead, the Kraft ownership group sent Glenn his ring by way of the US postal service.

2004 was an important year for The Screen Savers. Laporte left The Screen Savers to focus on hosting Call for Help, and Kevin Rose took his spot. Soon after Comcast bought TechTV in order to merge it with their struggling gaming channel G4, the TechTV offices were hit with massive layoffs affecting over 200 personnel. G4 moved the show to their studios in Los Angeles, California. The first Los Angeles based episode aired on September 7, 2004. Norton declined to move with the show, opting to remain in San Francisco with his new wife. Alex Albrecht took his spot. On November 11, 2004, Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane, and Alex Albrecht announced on their personal blogs that G4 had decided to revamp The Screen Savers by making it more pop culture, Internet, and gaming-oriented.

In 1991 he appeared as the co-host (along with Willow Bay) of "Etc., Etc.", a show on The Travel Channel. Lauer moved to WNBC-TV in 1992 where he became co-anchor, alongside Jane Hanson, of the early weekday news show Today in New York.

From the late 1960s through the 1980s, WNBC was involved in a fierce three-way battle with WCBS-TV and WABC-TV for the top spot in the New York television ratings. This continued during a lean period for NBC as a whole. WNBC's hallmark over the years has been strong coverage of breaking stories and a straight news products that also feature light-hearted and/or entertainment elements (i.e. Live at Five and Today in New York). Many of WNBC's personalities have been at the station for over 20 years. Chuck Scarborough has been the station's main anchor since 1974. From 1980 to 2012, he was teamed with Sue Simmons at 11 p.m., and the two were together longer than any anchor team in New York City television history.

In 1974, WBAL introduced the Action News format to Baltimore. Characterized by short, usually 90 second, news "packages" and upbeat introductory news themes, Baltimore's Action News briefly replaced WJZ as the number one news station in Baltimore during the mid-1970s. The architect of the success was news director Ron Kershaw, who had come to Baltimore from Texas and was considered somewhat ahead of his time. He brought in talented anchors like Sue Simmons and Spencer Christian and streamlined the news operation. Kershaw later brought other innovations to WNBC-TV in New York City and WBBM-TV in Chicago as news director at those stations.

The formation of the Society had been deemed necessary as a means of fighting colonial edition royalties. Since most publishing at the time took place in London, Australian authors received only half the royalty for the books they sold in Australia, which was often their most significant market. This problem was quickly dispensed with and the Society looked at other issues relevant to authors such as copyright, public lending right (a Public Lending Right Act was finally passed by the Australian Parliament in 1975, though it was a few more years before authors began to receive payments from the Public lending Right Scheme which is now administered by the Department of Communications Information Technology and the Arts) and Educational Lending Right. This last was achieved in 2000. The ASA administers the Barbara Jefferis Award, which is funded from a bequest from the late John Hinde in tribute to his wife who was a founding member of the Society. The Award was first presented in 2008 to Rhyll McMaster for her book Feather Man (Brandl & Schlesinger, Sydney, 2007) In 2009 it was awarded to The Spare Room by Helen Garner, in 2010 to The China Garden by Kristina Olsson (UQP), and in 2011 to Come Inside by G.L. Osborne (Clouds of Magellan).

In July 1957, after the failure of Tonight! America After Dark (a news-oriented program first hosted by Jack Lescoulie and briefly by Al Collins), NBC reverted its late night show, Tonight, to a talk/variety show format as it had been during Steve Allen's tenure as host. Jack Paar became the new solo host of the show. Under Paar, most of the NBC affiliates which had dropped the show during the ill-fated run of America After Dark (or who had never picked it up) began airing the show once again. Paar's era began the practice of branding the series after the host, and as such the program, though officially still called Tonight, was marketed as The Jack Paar Show. A combo band conducted by Paar's Army buddy pianist Jose Melis filled commercial breaks and backed musical entertainers. When Paar was on vacation, the show was presided over by guest hosts; one of these early hosts was Johnny Carson. Starting in 1960, it was one of the first regularly scheduled shows to be videotaped in color, with the show recorded very early in the evening and broadcast from 11:15 P.M. to 1 A.M. Eastern time that night. Only a handful of complete Jack Paar "Tonight Show" episodes exist. All of them are black-and-white kinescope recordings; no color videotapes of any complete Paar "Tonight" shows are known to exist). Paar hosted the program from 1957 to 1962.

Ask This Old House began in 2002 and was spun off from a section of This Old House Magazine of the same name. Readers of the magazine or viewers of the show submit questions about various home repair or improvement projects, which are answered by the experts. It has been nominated for 5 Emmy Awards. The regulars on the show are O'Connor, Tom Silva, Richard Trethewey and Roger Cook. (This Old House veteran Norm Abram does not appear on Ask This Old House due to numerous other commitments on Abram's part, notably his involvement in The New Yankee Workshop.) Guest experts appear to answer more specialized questions. The show takes place in "the loft" of a rural barn somewhere in the Boston area. Most of the questions are answered in the loft, but one or two homeowners in each episode receive a visit from one of the show's three tradesmen (or a guest tradesman if the project is not construction, plumbing/heating or landscaping related such as electrical or painting projects), who assist in either starting or completing the task with the homeowners' help. O'Connor sometimes assists in these projects. There is also a feature entitled "What Is It?" in which three of the four regulars try to guess what an unusual tool is used for. The adjudicating fourth regular reveals the actual use. Beginning with the 2007/08 season, this program added a "useful tip" segment provided by a viewer of the show. The useful tip segment is a revival of a short-lived feature of This Old House when Vila hosted the show.

The Tommy Hunter Show began as a CBC radio program in 1960 and went on to replace Country Hoedown on CBC Television in 1965; Hunter's show was picked up by TNN in 1983 and ran on CBC until 1992. The book Cue the Elephant by Knowlton Nash (1996, McClelland & Stewart) featured some disparaging remarks from the show's make-up artist. "He could sell himself terrifically but there was no love lost between Tommy and the crew. Some of the guys loathed him ... Everybody made snide remarks behind Tommy's back ... people might say he was the biggest jerk in the world. But that was not my experience. For me, I saw a very easy down-to-earth manner. But Tommy does generate anti as well as pro feelings from people ... he didn't trust people around him, he became a monster to some."

The airing of the program on CBC was seen as controversial not only because of the time shifting, but because it appears to contradict the corporation's mission as a public broadcaster that explains Canada to Canadians, which led to CBC Television dropping all primetime U.S. network series in the mid-1990s. Lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting described the move as "shocking and surprising" and says the decision also contradicts CBC president Robert Rabinovitch's fall 2005 claim that "we don't do reality television". Actors' union ACTRA called the decision a "sell-out". And in an acceptance speech for an award from the Canadian Journalism Foundation, read by his wife at a ceremony held during the debacle, former CBC anchor Knowlton Nash said, "If the CBC really wants reality TV, let people get the reality of what's happening in the world by turning on The National at 10 p.m. every night," construed by most as an indictment of the One decision.

The Jewish community in West Germany from the 1950s to the 1970s was characterized by its social conservatism and generally private nature. Although there were Jewish elementary schools in West Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, the community had a very high average age. Few young adults chose to remain in Germany, and many of those who did, married non-Jews. Many critics of the community and its leadership accused it of ossification. In the 1980s, a college for Jewish studies was established in Heidelberg; however, a disproportionate number of its students were not Jewish. By 1990, the community numbered between 30,000 and 40,000. Although the Jewish community of Germany did not have the same impact as the pre-1933 community, some Jews were prominent in German public life, including Hamburg mayor Herbert Weichmann; Schleswig-Holstein Minister of Justice (and Deputy Chief Justice of the Federal Constitutional Court) Rudolf Katz; Hesse Attorney General Fritz Bauer; former Hesse Minister of Economics Heinz-Herbert Karry; West Berlin politician Jeanette Wolff; television personalities Hugo Egon Balder, Hans Rosenthal, Ilja Richter, Inge Meysel, and Michel Friedman; Jewish communal leaders Heinz Galinski, Ignatz Bubis, Paul Spiegel, and Charlotte Knobloch (see: Central Council of Jews in Germany); and Germany's most influential literary critic, Marcel Reich-Ranicki.

The video is a parody of Eurovision Song Contest, it's also in greyscale. The video was filmed in a copy of the decoration of the German game show Dalli, Dalli (Hurry, hurry). The host in the video said after the song: "So, wir sind der Meinung, das war spitze" (now, in our opinion, that was great), in reference to the sentence of the Dalli, Dalli host Hans Rosenthal. He also jumped in the air and the jump was frozen, like Rosental in his show. The introduction, after the intro and before the song, was a parody on the introduction for the 60's music show Beatclub, made by Wilhelm Wieben.

Vasili's Garden is an Australian television gardening program. Hosted by Vasili Kanidiadis, each episode of the show, which is unscripted and largely unedited, focuses on the plants and produce from the garden of a migrant family from Melbourne, with Kanidiadis emphasising traditional methods of gardening and Greek cuisine. The show has become known for Kanidiadis' lively and sometimes outlandish methods of presentation of the show, his piano accordion playing at the end of the show and his use of the Greek phrase 'maresi' (translating to 'I like it' in English) throughout the show.

Upon leaving WNEW, Jorgensen initially co-anchored Action News with Pat Harper on WPIX. In June 1980, days after Ted Turner began the Cable News Network, WPIX began producing Independent Network News, a prime time national newscast that ran throughout the United States on small independent television stations. The Miami Herald described Independent Network News as a half-hour program of national and international news as well as brief sports and weather segments, offered to participating stations during prime time, and therefore not in direct competition with the networks' evening newscasts. Jorgensen anchored both a 10:00 national newscast and a 10:30 local newscast on WPIX with Steve Bosh and Pat Harper.

Since INN was produced by WPIX, that station's news team presided over the broadcast. The nightly broadcast was helmed by a three-anchor team consisting of Pat Harper, Bill Jorgensen, and Steve Bosh (the former two being WPIX's lead news team while Bosh was the frequent substitute) with Jerry Girard reporting on sports and Roberto Tirado providing national weather forecasts (he would be replaced by Bob Harris later on), and WPIX's local reporting staff was also utilized. INN also used reports from its member stations, The Associated Press, United Press International, Visnews, and later on CNN to supplement its own coverage.

From there, Marsh made the leap to New York City, where she began working at WCBS-TV in August 1979 as a reporter and then as co-anchor of the Saturday 11 p.m. edition of Channel 2 News. Within three months, Marsh was promoted to co-anchor of the 11 o'clock report alongside Rolland Smith in October 1979. Marsh was part of a wave of anchorwomen in New York local news, along with Sue Simmons, Rose Ann Scamardella, Judy Licht, and Pat Harper. Still only 25 years old, Marsh was the youngest of these, and was sometimes called "the baby of the newsroom" at her station.

Roker's career with NBC began in 1978 when he was hired at WKYC-TV in Cleveland, then an NBC owned-and-operated station. After five successful years in Cleveland, Roker was promoted to the network's flagship outlet, WNBC-TV in his hometown. Roker returned to New York City in late 1983 as a weekend meteorologist, and within eight months became the station's regular weeknight weathercaster. Roker replaced 27-year WNBC-TV veteran Dr. Frank Field, who left the network after a contract dispute. From 1983 to 1996, Roker was the regular substitute for forecaster Joe Witte on the NBC News program NBC News at Sunrise, and from 1990 to 1995 filled-in for Willard Scott on the Today Show. In 1995, he became the host of The Al Roker Show, a weekend talk show on CNBC. In 1996–1997, he hosted a game show on MSNBC called Remember This?.

Virtually all of the original pre-1970 video recordings, including Carson's debut as host, are now considered lost because of wiping. Following the standard procedure for most television production companies of that era, NBC reused The Tonight Show videotapes for recording other programs. It was rumored that many other episodes were lost in a fire, but NBC has denied this. Other surviving material from the era has been found on kinescopes held in the archives of the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service, or in the personal collections of guests of the program, while a few moments such as Tiny Tim's wedding, were preserved. New York meteorologist Dr. Frank Field, an occasional guest during the years he was weather forecaster for WNBC-TV, showed several clips of his appearances with Carson in a 2002 career retrospective on WWOR-TV; Field had maintained the clips in his own personal archives.

At one point, WCVB considered launching a competing program that was similarly structured (to be anchored by Peter Mehegan and Mary Richardson, who later became the long-running anchor team on Chronicle), but it was WNEV who made three attempts at a Live on 4-inspired show. First, it premiered the two-hour live talk/magazine show Look in the fall of 1982. After a year of disappointing ratings, Look was trimmed to an hour and retitled New England Afternoon. This, too, failed in the Nielsens, and was canceled in 1984. Three years later, WNEV tried the even more news-oriented copy New England News: Live at Five, which essentially became Boston's first proper 5 p.m. newscast, although it still featured the informal structure of Live on 4. Live at Five was a rare success in the ratings for WNEV's news, but in 1988, the format's creator, anchor Dave Wright (who imported it from ATV in Halifax), left the station following a feud between his news producers. WNEV's 5 p.m. news became a completely regular newscast thereafter, with its talent seated on the regular news set.

In the spring of 1986, Yanoff and Rosser announced that they would try a second lead anchor team for the weeknight 11 p.m. newscasts in the fall. They planned to keep Ellis and Willis on at 6 p.m., while giving the 11 p.m. slot to weekend anchor/reporter Kate Sullivan and Dave Wright, an incoming newsman hired away from ATV in the Canadian Maritimes. However, when Rosser had a meeting with Willis for what was supposed to be her contract renewal, he was told by her that instead, she would be leaving to become a professor of journalism at Northeastern University. Willis and Rosser publicly announced her resignation in July, and Willis assured the staff that her decision to leave WNEV was isolated from her soon-to-be decreased air time. Ellis, on the other hand, was unhappy about his reduction, feeling that he was no longer being considered the station's principal anchor. Yanoff and Rosser attempted to come to agreeable terms with Ellis, with two proposed plans – to either pair him with Kate Sullivan or Dave Wright, or to find him another replacement female anchor. It was purported that WNEV was even in discussions with by-then-former NBC anchor Linda Ellerbee for her to become Ellis' co-anchor. The anchor replacement and Wright-Ellis pairing ideas were ultimately nixed (by the 1980s, the idea of two men anchoring together was passe); in the end, Sullivan and Wright took over both the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts in September. Ellis was demoted to reporter, a move that ultimately led to his exit from the station altogether in early December 1986.

WCAU presently broadcasts 37½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours on weekdays, three hours on Saturdays and two hours on Sundays). News has been produced at WCAU from when the station went on the air on in 1948. Charles Shaw, who had worked with Edward R. Murrow as a CBS correspondent in London during World War II, was the station's news director from 1948 until he left the station in the early 1960s. John Facenda, who later gained fame as the voice of NFL Films, was the station's main anchorman from shortly after it signed on until 1973. At the time he retired, he had been a main anchor longer than anyone in Philadelphia; he has since been passed by WPVI's Jim Gardner.

In 1970, Channel 6 stole first place in the Philadelphia news ratings. It has dominated the ratings for most of the time ever since, winning virtually every time slot. Its dominance has only been seriously challenged twice – in the 1980s, when WCAU-TV briefly took the lead at 5 p.m.; and in 2001, when WCAU took first place at 11 p.m. for a few months for the first time in decades. Many top executives in ABC's television station group worked at WPVI. WPVI's longtime anchor Jim Gardner and weatherman Dave Roberts respectively joined the station in 1976 and 1978, after each had spent time at WPVI's sister station WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York. Sports anchor Gary Papa joined in 1981 from another Buffalo station, WGR-TV. Most of WPVI's on-air staff has been at the station for over ten years, and several for twenty years or more.

In January 2008, Karvelas and his fiancé Annita Pania had a son named Andreas. In November 2008, Pania and Karvelas were arrested by the police after an alleged police chase, which started off with them running a red light. The incident supposedly started when a car, driven by Karvelas, ran a red light. Police then allegedly followed them and turned their sirens on to pull them over. Karvelas allegedly continued on, running further red lights and driving erratically, while the police continued to chased him. Pania and Karvelas allege that they were listening to a new song Karvelas wrote, with the volume up high, and did no hear any sirens and were not aware of any police. They also deny ever running the red light. Later, the couple claimed that the policemen not only were overzealous, commanding and rude (using the word re), but also threatened them with their weapons. Pania also mentioned later on TV that she does respect the police, but on the other hand the couple would not comply to "bullies", "cops" and "baskines" (the latter is a pejorative Greek word signifying policemen), whose insulting behavior rather "reminded of the Greek Junta". The couple vowed to take the subject up in court. Pania and Karvelas were later judged in court, found guilty and sentenced to 14 and 10 months in prison respectively, though they were allowed to buy out their sentences.

In 1975, NBC canceled Jeopardy! after moving it twice on its daytime schedule, despite having an additional year on its network contract left to fulfill. Griffin produced the show's successor, Wheel of Fortune. Premiering on January 6, 1975, Wheel with Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford as host and hostess, had mediocre ratings throughout its network run, yet was expanded to an hour, in response to the successful 60-minute version of The Price Is Right on CBS. It barely escaped cancellation in 1980, when NBC replaced all its other game shows with a daytime talk show starring David Letterman; NBC finally cancelled it in 1989, when CBS picked it up for a year, only to return to NBC, when the daytime version was finally cancelled for good in 1991. Wheel of Fortune became a phenomenon when on September 19, 1983, a nighttime version hit the syndication market with Pat Sajak and Vanna White as host and hostess, respectively. Two different revivals of Jeopardy! would be produced: one on NBC that ran for five months in late 1978/early 1979 with Art Fleming returning as host, and the other airing in first-run syndication beginning on September 10, 1984, starring Alex Trebek. Both the daytime syndicated version of Jeopardy! and the nighttime version of Wheel of Fortune remain on the air today in syndication.

After Wheel of Fortune hostess Susan Stafford left in October 1982, White was chosen as one of three substitute hostesses (along with Vicki McCarty and Summer Bartholomew) to co-host the show. On December 13, 1982, White became the show's regular hostess and has remained as the show's daytime hostess.

As television assumed an increasingly prominent role in American family life in the late 1950s, NBC News became television's "champion of news coverage." NBC President Robert Kintner believed that a dominant NBC News could lift his entire network to the top, and he provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time. In 1956, the network paired anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, and the two went on to acquire great celebrity. They were supported by a strong bench of reporters that over time included John Chancellor, Frank McGee, Edwin Newman, Sander Vanocur, Nancy Dickerson, Tom Pettit, and Ray Scherer.

The band changed their name to the 'The Makers' in 1976 as a punk band and played at the Roxy in the early years. In 1978 they became a power pop band and changed their name to Gentry and played a small number of gigs, including at Kingsway College. They later changed their name to Spandau Ballet after a friend of the band, journalist and DJ Robert Elms, saw the name 'Spandau Ballet' scrawled on the wall of a nightclub lavatory during a visit to Berlin. This name refers to Spandau Prison and the many hangings there when the victims would twitch and jump at the end of a rope. The new Spandau Ballet, with Martin Kemp and Tony Hadley, began performing with this name and generating a positive buzz around London. Their music prior to then was in the style of the early Rolling Stones or The Kinks, but became more electronic as they began to hang out in clubs such as Billy's and Blitz, where they would listen to bands like Kraftwerk and Telex. The Blitz was regarded as the New Romanticism.

Simon Lederman is a radio presenter in the UK. He presents a Saturday morning breakfast show with JoAnne Good and the Simon Lederman Show on BBC London 94.9 Monday to Thursday 10pm-1am.

He is also a regular presenter of the weekday breakfast show behind Paul Ross, weekday Drivetime behind Eddie Nestor, and the weekday Vanessa Feltz phone-in on the same station.

He stands in for Robert as presenter of the Robert Elms programme and for many years he was also a regular contributor to the show, each week taking listeners on an audio bus tour of London, with Lederman describing the areas of London which specific London bus routes travelled through. For this reason he gained two titles: The Bus Biographer and The Route Master.

Some listeners gave him the nickname Captain Lentil due to his sometimes liberal views and he is still referred to as Captain or The Lentilist by some phone-in callers. He also presented the BBC Three Counties Radio breakfast show until June 2012.

In 2013, Miranda Sawyer, reviewing Lederman's show in the Sunday Observer newspaper, called him 'an upbeat ranter who forces you to have an opinion on news stories just through the tone of his voice' and that at least one other show 'needs some of what Lederman is drinking.'

Until 1900s the Iberian wolf inhabited the major part of the Iberian Peninsula. However, the Francoist Government started an extermination campaign during the 1950s and 1960s that wiped out the animals from all of Spain except the NW part of the country, where there is still a sizeable population in Sierra de la Culebra, and some isolated areas in Sierra Morena. Similar policies in Portugal almost led to the extinction of the animal south of the Douro river (there are still some surviving packs). Some Spanish naturalists and conservationists like Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente called for the end of the hunting and the protection of the animal. Today, the hunting of wolves is banned in Portugal but allowed in some parts of Spain. Overall, the Iberian wolf is expanding to the south and east. There are reports of wolves returning to Navarre and the Basque Country and to the provinces of Extremadura, Madrid and Guadalajara. A male wolf was found recently in Catalonia, where the last native wolf was killed in 1929. However, this animal was not a member of the Iberian subspecies, but an Italian wolf (Canis lupus italicus) migrating from France.

From the beginning, Mosterín collaborated with Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente, famous Spanish naturalist and media personality, in the advancement of knowledge and appreciation of wild nature and particularly of wild animals. Mosterín has repeatedly taken a strong public position against bullfighting and other forms of mistreatment of animals. He contributed decisively to the discussion leading to the ban of bullfighting in Catalonia (Spain) in July 2010. Subsequently he has published a lucid analysis of this cruel tradition and a devastating philosophical refutation of all proposed attempts to justify it. As honorary president of the Spanish Great Ape Project, he has cooperated with Peter Singer in advocating certain minimal legal rights for great apes. Mosterín does not believe in the existence of intrinsic, metaphysical rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he thinks that any political society can create rights through legislative action of Parliament. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than just abstract and uncheckable speculations on intrinsic rights.

Rip-Off Republic was an RTÉ television show highlighting the cost of living and working in Ireland. It was presented by Eddie Hobbs and was broadcast on Mondays at 21:30 on RTÉ One during late August and early September 2005. The series was a phenomenon that attracted the largest TV audience in Ireland for a factual series - other than sports events. The carryover from Hobbs satire rocked the Fianna Fáil / PD Government at the height of the Celtic Tiger as Hobbs polemic demonstrated how development land costs had permeated through nearly every cost of living.

Jesaulenko's marking skill was perhaps best highlighted by a spectacular mark over big Collingwood ruckman Graeme Jenkin in the 1970 VFL Grand Final. The commentary has Mike Williamson shouting the now famous phrase "Oh Jesaulenko, you beauty!". This "specky" is acclaimed by some to be the "Mark of the Century" and was the first to be recognised officially as the Mark of the Year; the medal awarded to the annual winner is called the Alex Jesaulenko Medal. Jesaulenko has downplayed the specky, citing other marks he took—even during the same game—as greater feats. He later said: "The images make it look classical, like it was taken from the marking manual, ... It was against Collingwood, a Grand Final, the biggest crowd ever, Graeme's a six-foot-four ruckman, I guess there's a mystique in standing on top of him with your arms outstretched." The mark is captured in Jamie Cooper's painting the Game That Made Australia, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.

On weeknights, the Newshour is fronted by news anchors Fred Hutton and Lynn Burry, and weather personality Toni-Marie Wiseman. (As a frequent substitute anchor, and Sunday co-anchor with Larry Jay, Wiseman is always credited equally with Hutton and Burry, an anomaly in North American TV news.) While popular, some have criticized its focus on the St. John's area, and particularly events there such as car accidents, while marginalizing reports from the rest of the province; the station has made efforts to dispel such concerns by employing additional journalists and stringers province-wide.

The Dickies' style is campy and humorous, influenced by The Ramones, for whom they sometimes opened in venues especially on the East coast, such as CBGB in the Bowery of NYC and across the river in the "The Showplace" Dover NJ (1978), along with the Nerds, Nozon and featuring the Ramones. This Eastern blitz made them a punk band of national recognition coming from the L.A. Scene. The Dickies are popular in the United Kingdom, and had a Top 10 single with "Banana Splits (Tra La La Song)" in 1979. Many of their lyrics concern Southern California culture, rife with references and in-jokes; examples include songs like "Waterslide", "I'm A Cholo", "Manny, Moe, and Jack", and "(I'm Stuck in a Pagoda with) Tricia Toyota". They are also known for recording many fast-paced punk covers of classic rock songs, including The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin," Black Sabbath's "Paranoid," The Monkees' "She," Barry McGuire's "Eve of Destruction," The Isley Brothers' "Nobody but Me," The Left Banke's "Pretty Ballerina," The Cowsills' "Hair", as well as the cover album Dogs from the Hare that Bit Us.

KNBC has had a very stable news team over the years: weeknight anchor Colleen Williams (who also occasionally reports for MSNBC and NBC News), sports director Fred Roggin (who serves as sports anchor for NBC's Early Today and is a sports announcer for NBC's Olympics coverage) and chief weathercaster Fritz Coleman (who like Roggin, also occasionally appears on The Tonight Show, and once hosted a late night variety show for KNBC called It's Fritz from 1989 to the early 1990s) have each been at the station more than 25 years. Former KNBC anchor Paul Moyer worked two stints at channel 4; first from 1972 to 1979 (when he began a 13-year run at rival KABC-TV) and from July 1992 until his May 2009 retirement. Like Moyer, anchor Chuck Henry was also a mainstay at KABC-TV, before making the move to channel 4 in January 1994. He currently produces (through his self-titled production company) the travelogue series Travel Cafe, which airs weekends on KNBC. Kelly Lange, Stu Nahan, John Schubeck, Tritia Toyota, Jess Marlow, David Sheehan, John Beard and Nick Clooney are other notables who have worked on KNBC's newscasts in the past.

In 1972 Schubeck moved to KABC-TV in Los Angeles as an anchor, and in 1974 joined KNBC, where he remained until 1983. There he was part of a news team which, in the late 1970s, also included co-anchors Tritia Toyota and Kelly Lange, sportscaster Stu Nahan and weatherman Pat Sajak (who would go on to greater fame as host of Wheel of Fortune beginning in 1981). Schubeck made it a point, at the opening of each newscast, to acknowledge whichever announcer was on duty at the time (during his run as anchor at the station, KNBC's announcing staff included Donald Rickles, not to be confused with the insult comic of the same name; Peggy Taylor, who had been the resident singer on The Stan Freberg Show in 1957; Don Stanley; and Victor Bozeman), all of whom have since passed on. He also was an anchor of the prime-time NBC News Updates for airing in the Pacific Time Zone for much of his stay at channel 4.

Schubeck was one of the earliest millionaire local television news anchors. He generated around $1 million a year during his stints. However, through his life he had battled alcoholism. Schubeck lost his life to kidney and liver failure, when aged 61. Friends say that the stress of covering news events, often involving calamity contributed to his alcoholism and his career setbacks and untimely death. He died in relative obscurity although an obituary appeared in The New York Times. In a tribute to a fellow journalism colleague, close friend and co-anchor Tritia Toyota reportedly paid for his memorial services.

At the 1991 national convention, Knox's supporters were elected to the board, and named staff lobbyist Wayne LaPierre as the executive vice president. The NRA focused its attention on the gun control policies of the Clinton Administration. Knox again lost power in 1997, as he lost reelection to a coalition of moderate leaders who supported movie star Charlton Heston, despite Heston's past support of gun control legislation. In 1994, the NRA unsuccessfully opposed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, but successfully lobbied for the ban's 2004 expiration. Heston was elected president in 1998 and became a highly visible spokesman for the organization. In an effort to improve the NRA's image, Heston presented himself as the voice of reason in contrast to Knox.

Consistent with its mainstream critics, the majority of the US feels strengthening the UN is unimportant or only somewhat important, with a minority holding the view that strengthening the UN is very important. While most agree that the UN could be improved, Noam Chomsky, a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, proposes that measures such as the US relinquishing its veto power in the Security Council and submitting to the rulings of the International Court of Justice could significantly improve the UN's ability to foster the growth of democracy and promote global peace and the protection of human rights. However, some American organizations and individuals, such as the John Birch Society and Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, oppose the United Nations on the basis of its perceived failures. LaPierre wrote the book "The Global War on Your Guns," in which he alerts the U.S. to the supposed threat of the Arms Trade Treaty.

Michael D. Barnes, then-president of the Brady Campaign, responded to the NRA's statements on the Five-seven by challenging NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre to be shot with the pistol while wearing a Kevlar vest. The NRA again attacked the Brady Campaign's statements, saying that "Barnes demonstrated his group's complete and utter disregard for gun safety and its flaming zeal to further restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners." In the same year, two pieces of legislation were introduced in the United States Congress, specifically targeting the Five-seven pistol and 5.7×28mm ammunition for a federal ban: the H.R. 1136: PLEA Act was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), and the S. 527: PLEA Act was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ); neither bill proceeded to a vote by the House or Senate.	Michael D.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) and the Brady Campaign were both early and vocal supporters of Project Exile, The NRA lobbied the U.S. Congress to help secure $2.3 million for emulation of Exile in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Camden County, New Jersey, where similar firearms-related violence has plagued the communities. The NRA has remained a strong supporter of the program as its focus is on severely punishing all gun crimes especially illegal possession rather than by making gun purchases more difficult.

The NRA had led another plaintiff action in the McConnell v FEC case, and the group's President, Wayne LaPierre had promised that he would build an institutional press empire to retain his group's First Amendment rights to comment on elections.

Angered citizens, backed by the National Rifle Association and other organizations, filed protests over the constitutionality of such an order and the difficulty in tracking seizures, as paperwork was rarely filed during the searches. Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, defended the right of affected citizens to retain firearms, saying that, "What we’ve seen in Louisiana - the breakdown of law and order in the aftermath of disaster - is exactly the kind of situation where the Second Amendment was intended to allow citizens to protect themselves." The searches received little news coverage, though reaction from groups such as the NRA, the Second Amendment Foundation, and Gun Owners of America was immediate and heated, and a lawsuit was filed September 22 by the NRA and SAF on behalf of two firearm owners whose firearms were seized. On September 23, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana issued a restraining order to bar further firearms confiscations.

In 1995, National Rifle Association (NRA) Executive Vice-president Wayne LaPierre sparked controversy when he referred to federal agents as "jackbooted government thugs"; the comment caused former U.S. President George H.W. Bush to cancel his lifetime membership in the organization. The resignation of so public a figure as Mr. Bush prompted an open letter from the association to the former president to be published in major newspapers; the letter included a litany of alleged and settled cases of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms abuses and an assertion that LaPierre and the NRA were merely borrowing a well-worn phrase uttered by other public figures in their calls for reform of the agency, among them Representative John Dingell of Michigan.

The series had its genesis, or beginnings, in 1953, when public television station WQED debuted The Children's Corner, a program featuring Rogers as puppeteer and Josie Carey as host, in an unscripted live television program. It was this program where many of the puppets, characters and music used in the later series were developed, such as King Friday XIII, and Curious X the Owl. It was also the time when Rogers began wearing his famous sneakers, as he found them to be quieter than his work shoes while he was moving about behind the set. The show won a Sylvania Award for best children's show, and was briefly broadcast nationally on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).

The station achieved early success with its newscasts after the affiliation switch to ABC, due in part to the station's hirings of many well-known Birmingham television personalities: news anchors Brenda Ladun and Linda Mays, sports anchor Mike Raita, and meteorologists James Spann and Mark Prater, all of whom had worked at rival WBRC. Former WVTM-TV news personalities Pam Huff and Tracy Haynes were later hired to anchor the station's early morning newscasts. Despite being a newer competitor to the other Birmingham stations (even though WCFT and WJSU had already established news departments prior to becoming satellites of WBMA-LD), the station regularly competes with WBRC – and since the mid-2000s, a ratings-surgent WIAT – for the #1 local newscast in the Birminghan-Anniston-Tuscaloosa market.

As could have been surmised from the title, the program was sponsored by Coca-Cola. The house band was Axel Stordahl and His Orchestra, and beginning in 1956 the singing group The Echoes appeared as a permanent backup group for Fisher and his frequent guest stars. The program was generally presented live, but was occasionally filmed in advance or shot on location. Coke Time with Eddie Fisher was last aired on February 22, 1957, although the series was by then sponsored by Standard Brands' Planters peanuts, as Coca-Cola previously cancelled their sponsorship during 1956 due to a dispute with bottlers over a proposed larger Coke bottle.

The series was a spin-off of DuMont's popular Cavalcade of Stars. Originally hosted by Fred Robbins, a disc jockey from New York, Robbins would exit quickly. No host would stay long on the program. Subsequent hosts included Warren Hull, Ted Steele, and Buddy Rogers. According to Brooks and Marsh (1984), Cavalcade of Bands was a major television effort, and was designed to lure away NBC's audience after The Milton Berle Show.

In 2004, MLC held its first benefit to raise money for the students and program. Since then, once a year, usually at the end of April, MLC holds a benefit to raise money for the program. The Gala, as it is commonly referred, raises money to help with scholarships for families in need of assistance, as well as support program costs. It consists of both a silent and live auction, accompanied by a formal sit down meal and various speakers, including students in the program.

Desperate to atone for the previous year's debacle, Network Ten replaced Gretel Killeen and Daniel MacPherson with Kim Watkins (host of 9am with David and Kim at the Sydney Opera House) and Andrew Günsberg (host of Australian Idol at Dawes Point) respectively. The Dawes Point reporter was Fuzzy from Video Hits. The celebrations kicked off with The Potbelleez performing "Don't Hold Back". After that, a recording was done, which showed a scientist predicting what the world would be like in the year 2050, which would be affected by global warming. The presenters at the Royal Botanic Gardens were Wesley Denning from Totally Wild, Pip Russell (dressed as Alice in Wonderland) and Dan Sweetman (dressed as a white rabbit) from Toasted TV and Dr. Rob Bell from Scope (who was the only one not in fancy dress), as the theme for the Lord Mayor's Picnic was "Once Upon a Time". It included face painting, Wesley Denning dressed as Prince Charming to wake up Pip Russell who was playing Sleeping Beauty with a kiss. Denning said the fairytales are about "magic" which is what Pip said about the fireworks, but Dr. Rob begged to differ on that, stating that fireworks are scientific. He did a recording on it. He started off with saying that fireworks "come from a range of different colours, all of which are due to the excited states of different metal atoms". He decided to take a salt that contains a metal, opting to use table salt, because it's sodium chloride. The flame was blue, but it became an orange colour, because "all of the sodium atoms in there are getting really, really excited". He tried a copper one, which made the flame a green colour. He said fireworks work on the same principle as a match. It is a chemical reaction called "combustion". He lit the match. He also said that fireworks don't use wood as a fuel, but they use charcoal and sulphur. To do his own demonstration, he used sugar as a fuel, in the form of a jelly baby. For oxygen, he said you can't use air with a match because "it just doesn't create big enough explosions". So instead, he used chemicals called oxidiser that contain lots of oxygen. So he held a test tube (which had the sugar at the bottom) by the tweezers and rolled the jelly baby in the sugar (not the one in the test tube) and eventually he combined them. He put the jelly baby in the test tube, which triggered a chemical reaction. That was the end of the recording. After the commercial break, Tarisai Vushe, Ben McKenzie and Jacob Butler all performed, then the three of them performed "Dancing in the Moonlight". After the commercial break, Andrew Günsberg handed proceedings to Wes, Pip, Dan and Dr. Rob at the Lord Mayor's Picnic to lead the countdown. Dr. Rob stated that in the ten seconds it takes to count down to the fireworks, an object, travelling at the speed of light, could go around the Earth seventy times. Then they led the countdown and the fireworks started off in style, starting off with "What Time Is It?" from High School Musical 2.

H.I.P. H.O.P. was France's very first television show to be dedicated to the hip hop culture. It was broadcast each Sunday afternoon on the French national channel TF1 in 1984, for 43 weeks. The host was Sidney along with the Paris City Breakers. They had guests such as Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, Futura 2000, Afrika Bambaataa and The Rock Steady Crew. However, Michael Holman, host of Graffiti Rock, claims to be the very first person to broadcast a nationwide, Hip Hop TV Show called Graffiti Rock (June, 1984, 88 syndicated stations across the US, starring Kool Moe Dee, Special K, Run DMC, The New York City Breakers). However, years before, in 1982, Holman aired on New York Cable TV two much earlier shows that were dedicated to Hip Hop Culture called "On Beat" and "TV New York." Both these shows beat both H.I.P. H.O.P. and Graffiti Rock by at least two years and featured Hip Hop artists such as: Fab 5 Freddy, DJ High Priest, The New York City Breakers, Phase II, Futura, DJ Jazzy Joyce, K-Rob & Tim Single.

After his birth in France, Kohndo moved to Benin (West Africa) where his family originated. A few years later he moved back to France, and grew up in Bobigny, a suburb located north-east of Paris. In 1984, he discovered part of Hip-Hop culture through the TV Show, H.I.P. H.O.P. hosted by Sidney. In 1987, he relocated to the "Cité du Pont de Sèvre" (Pont de Sèvre Housing Projects) in Boulogne Billancourt, a wealthier suburb located west of Paris. There he befriended his downstairs neighbor whose family, like his, came from Benin, and who would be later known in the rap scene as Zoxea, a member of Les Sages Poètes de la Rue. With Zoxea, Kohndo discovered the deeper aspects of Hip-Hop, and after having learned ‘human beatboxing’ began rapping. Zoxea introduced Kohndo to his cousin: Egosyst, with whom he formed the band: "Coup d’Etat Phonique" alongside producer Lumumba and then-young rapper, Raphael. In 1994, at a radio show, Egosyst and Kohndo met Daddy Lord C, a rapper and former member of the Black Dragons, a Parisian gang. With Daddy Lord C, producer Chimiste, dj Jelahee and Rocca they would form La Cliqua.	hosted by Sidney.	/m/0414vy9	Sidney_Duteil	10	16	/broadcast/artist,/people/person,/tv/tv_personality
In the early part of the decade, B-boying became the first aspect of hip hop culture to reach Japan, Australia and South Africa, where the crew Black Noise established the practice before beginning to rap later in the decade. Musician and presenter Sidney became France's first black TV presenter with his show H.I.P. H.O.P. which screened on TF1 during 1984, a first for the genre worldwide. Radio Nova helped launch other French stars including Dee Nasty whose 1984 album Paname City Rappin' along with compilations Rapattitude 1 and 2 contributed to a general awareness of Hip Hop in France.

The discography of French house music DJ and producer David Guetta consists of five studio albums, ten compilation albums, two extended plays, forty-one singles (including seven as a featured artist), nine promotional singles and thirty-seven music videos. Guetta released his debut single "Nation Rap", a collaboration with French rapper Sidney, in 1990. His debut studio album, Just a Little More Love, was released in June 2002; it peaked at number six in France and was certified two times gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP). Three of the album's singles attained commercial success in several European territories, including France and Belgium: "Just a Little More Love", "Love Don't Let Me Go" and "People Come People Go". Guetta Blaster, his second studio album, peaked at number 11 in France and produced four singles: "Money", "Stay", "The World Is Mine" and "In Love with Myself". In 2006, a mash-up of "Love Don't Let Me Go" and "Walking Away" by British electronic music band The Egg was released, entitled "Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)". It performed well in Europe, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom and becoming a top forty hit in several other European countries.

Since 2008, TSN and RDS are the exclusive television and Internet broadcasters of all CFL games, including the playoffs and Grey Cup. The five-year agreement, which includes an option for a sixth year, is worth about $16 million annually and marks the first time since 1952 that CBC will not be broadcasting any CFL games. The CFL will no longer be broadcast on Canadian terrestrial television, unless TSN chooses to air the game on its terrestrial partners, CTV or CTV Two (formerly A-Channel); as of 2011, TSN has not transferred any CFL games to broadcast TV. The move to TSN all but assures that all CFL games will be broadcast in high definition. As of 2006, TSN was available in about 8.8 million of Canada's 13 million households. The two play-by-play announcers are Chris Cuthbert and Rod Black while the colour commentators are Glen Suitor (with Cuthbert) and Duane Forde (with Black). Instead of merely exercising the option on the contract, TSN opted to renew the contract with the CFL (and thus extend the terrestrial blackout) through 2018 in an agreement announced in March 2013.

On April 9, 2007, WFLD premiered a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast called The TEN, anchored by David Novarro and former WLS-TV and WBBM-TV anchor/reporter Lauren Cohn. The program (according to Robert Feder's April 18, 2007 column in the Chicago Sun-Times), beat CBS-owned WBBM-TV's 10 p.m. newscast on its second day on the air. Despite its early success against WBBM-TV, overall The TEN was never much of a factor in the ratings; towards the end of its run, it fell to a distant fifth behind newscasts on WBBM, WLS-TV and WMAQ-TV, and Family Guy reruns on WGN-TV. This factor resulted in the program's cancellation on September 21, 2009.

In March 1994, Sirott returned to work, anchoring "Fox Thing in the Morning" on Chicago's FOX affiliate WFLD with his future wife Marianne Murciano, until she was moved to another time slot at the station in June 2000. It was ranked high in the Nielsen ratings, and fans were taken aback when they learned that the show was unceremoniously cancelled and renamed "Fox News in the Morning." On September 27, 2000, Sirott was bounced as the station's host—concurrent with the show's renaming. News reports had stated that Sirott didn't want to work with new anchor, Tamron Hall, who had replaced his wife, but Sirott downplayed those rumors in a Chicago Sun-Times article on September 28, 2000. "It's not about Tamron," he told the paper. "It's about changes in the focus and direction of the show." Sirott was removed as co-host with 2½ years remaining on his contract, and he was nominally kept on WFLD's payroll to develop new programming for Fox stations and the company's syndication division. On July 19, 2010, Sirott rejoined WFLD as co-anchor of the 9 p.m. news alongside Robin Robinson.

Other artists who made the pop charts after getting exposure on the Dr. Demento show include Larry Groce ("Junk Food Junkie", 1975) and Elmo and Patsy ("Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer", 1979). The show helped revive and maintain interest in novelty hits from the 1950s and 1960s that received scant airplay on mainstream pop or oldies radio stations, including "Alley Oop" by the Hollywood Argyles, "The Ballad of Irving" by Frank Gallop, "The Battle of Kookamonga" by Homer and Jethro, "Monster Mash" by Bobby "Boris" Pickett, "Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah (A Letter from Camp)" by Allan Sherman, "I Want My Baby Back" by Jimmy Cross, and "They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!" by Napoleon XIV. Hansen also revived interest in the double entendre songs of 1940s Borscht Belt comedian Benny Bell, especially Bell's signature tune, "Shaving Cream". He introduced a new generation to the manic big-band parodies of Spike Jones, the musical black humor of Tom Lehrer, and the many novelty records recorded by satirist Stan Freberg in the 1950s.

Perry's announcer on the broadcasts, Frank Gallop, became a foil for Como's jokes.

There was as much fun at rehearsals as on the show itself. Como's relaxed and fun-loving manner at rehearsals put many nervous guests at ease. It was common for Como to leave the Saturday afternoon rehearsal for about a half-hour to go to confession. He managed to save some time by asking his music publisher, Mickey Glass, to wait in line for him at the confessional. Glass, who was Jewish, was most agreeable to this, but wondered what to do if his turn came before Como arrived.

Coe initially produced this second series but, for much of its run, the live 1949-1952 program was sponsored by appliance maker Admiral, produced by Herbert Bayard Swope, Jr., directed by Laurence Schwab, Jr., and hosted by Frank Gallop. Critical response was mixed but the program was successful for several seasons (sometimes appearing in the weekly lists of the ten most watched network shows) until competition from the massively popular sitcom I Love Lucy on CBS helped to kill it off.

Educated at Boston College, graduating in 1932, he gained his first radio job in his hometown, at Boston's WLOE. When he was hired by NBC in 1935, he decamped for New York, along with his friend, fellow Boston announcer Frank Gallop, who was hired by CBS. In their early days as network announcers, Herlihy and Gallop shared an apartment on West 45th Street. He was immediately successful in network radio, at that time in its sharpest ascendancy. He was the announcer for many radio shows from the 1930s, to the 1950s, among them: America's Town Meeting, The Big Show, The Falcon, Mr. District Attorney, and Just Plain Bill. Herlihy became the host of the The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour on radio in 1948, remaining its announcer when the show went to television. He continued his success in the new medium: his early television credits included Sid Caesar's hit Your Show of Shows and soap operas As the World Turns and All My Children. He was also the host of Recollections At 30, which was a special NBC Radio series created for the network's 30th birthday.

Excitedly, Lex and Tom board a small plane which flies them to the Maasai Mara. Along the way, herds of wildebeest roam throughout the ground below. Once they land, Lex and Tom are taken to a place called Governors' Camp, which Lex describes as the ultimate five-star luxury hotel in the middle of a lush African jungle. As Lex helps himself to a few refreshments, Tom is overjoyed at the accommodations in their tent, especially the big bed and working toilet. Lex and Tom are amazed to see a few hippos in the nearby Mara River. Soon after Lex hands Jeff's Visa card to a lady who checks them in, he and Tom feast on more refreshments and agree not to divulge too much about their stay at the resort when they return to camp. Meanwhile, back at Moto Maji, Kim J. and Kim P. are passing the time using paper, paints and brushes to make a deck of playing cards from scratch. Both are jealous of all the food that Lex and Tom will eat on their trip. Later, at the Maasai Mara, Lex and Tom are on board a safari truck and look at all the wildlife they pass by including warthogs, zebras, giraffes, lions, elephants and hundreds of migrating wildebeests. Both enjoy the experience immensely. Tom even goes as far as to say that he feels like Marlin Perkins. When they return to their tent, Lex and Tom find a few bottles of alcoholic beverages and drink a few toasts to their adventure and to the game of Survivor. Soon afterwards, they eat a big dinner of grilled chicken, lamb and vegetables. That night, at Moto Maji, Kim P., who is not enjoying the tribe's usual cornmeal mush, claims she will never eat corn again, not even popcorn at the movies. Back at the Governors' Camp, Lex is amused as Tom continues to drink the liquor and laugh at his own cheers, but is wise enough to help Tom to the bed under the tent.

The World Bird Sanctuary can be found inside Lone Elk Park. Visitors can see famous or lesser-known birds of prey and other wild birds. During the summer and spring months they are always on display, and at listed times there are bird shows. The sanctuary was founded in 1977 by ornithologist Walter C. Crawford, Jr. Crawford began his career at the St. Louis City Zoo. Crawford, working with Wild Kingdom star Marlin Perkins, recognized a need for an organization dedicated to birds of prey. Today, Mr. Crawford continues to direct the organization he founded. He also travels nationwide to speak at conventions and banquets with his humorous and inspirational message of environmental conservation.

Wildlife has long been a common subject for educational television shows. National Geographic specials appeared on CBS beginning in 1965, later moving to ABC and then PBS. In 1963, NBC debuted Wild Kingdom, a popular program featuring zoologist Marlin Perkins as host. The BBC natural history unit in the UK was a similar pioneer, the first wildlife series LOOK presented by Sir Peter Scott, was a studio-based show, with filmed inserts. It was in this series that David Attenborough first made his appearance which led to the series Zoo Quest during which he and cameraman Charles Lagus went to many exotic places looking for and filming elusive wildlife—notably the Komodo dragon in Indonesia and lemurs in Madagascar. Since 1984, the Discovery Channel and its spin off Animal Planet in the US have dominated the market for shows about wildlife on cable television, while on PBS the NATURE strand made by WNET-13 in New York and NOVA by WGBH in Boston are notable. See also Nature documentary. Wildlife television is now a multi-million dollar industry with specialist documentary film-makers in many countries including UK, US, New Zealand NHNZ, Australia, Austria, Germany, Japan, and Canada. There are many magazines which cover wildlife including National Wildlife Magazine, Birds & Blooms, Birding (magazine), and Ranger Rick (for children).

A political liberal, Terkel joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Writers' Project, working in radio, doing work that varied from voicing soap opera productions and announcing news and sports, to presenting shows of recorded music and writing radio scripts and advertisements. His well-known radio program, titled The Studs Terkel Program, aired on 98.7 WFMT Chicago between 1952 and 1997. The one-hour program was broadcast each weekday during those forty-five years. On this program, he interviewed guests as diverse as Bob Dylan, Leonard Bernstein, Jean Shepherd, and Alexander Frey. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Terkel was also the central character of Studs' Place, an unscripted television drama about the owner of a greasy-spoon diner in Chicago through which many famous people and interesting characters passed. This show, along with Marlin Perkins's Zoo Parade, Garroway at Large and the children's show Kukla, Fran, and Ollie, are widely considered canonical examples of the Chicago School of Television.

Marlin Perkins, who gained fame as the host of the television program Zoo Parade and later, Wild Kingdom, was director of the zoo from 1944 until 1962. He created and recruited a citizens group to support the Zoo's mission, the Lincoln Park Zoological Society. The facility underwent a dramatic transformation in the 1970s and 1980s, with the additions of many new, naturalistic exhibits. In 1995, the Zoological Society assumed management of the zoo from the Chicago Park District, which remains the owner. Zoo administration is currently housed in the nearby building previously used by the Chicago Academy of Sciences, which moved to a new facility in 1999.

The original Wild Kingdom grew from discussions that started in 1962 between zoologist Marlin Perkins and V. J. Skutt, the chairman and CEO of insurance company Mutual of Omaha. The company had been the sponsor of an earlier animal-related show, Zoo Parade, that Perkins had hosted from 1952 until 1957. Also intimately involved with the creation of Wild Kingdom was Zoo Parade producer Don Meier, who was credited as the series' creator. Mutual of Omaha sponsored and lent its name to the new program.

In 1982, McKeown anchored a special Fifth Estate report about animal cruelty in Hollywood, focusing on the 1958 Walt Disney film White Wilderness as well as the television program Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom. In the report, McKeown found that the lemming scene was filmed not at the Arctic Ocean, but at the Bow River near downtown Calgary, where the lemmings were forced into the river; in addition, he also discovered that the footage of a polar bear cub falling down an Arctic ice slope was in actuality filmed in a Calgary film studio. In light of the findings for the report, McKeown asked Wild Kingdom host Marlin Perkins if he had deliberately injured or killed animals while making wildlife films. Perkins, then in his seventies, "firmly asked for the camera to be turned off, then punched a shocked McKeown in the face."

Major developments in 19th century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War, had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.

Cadwgan Circle
Though the population of the Rhondda was embracing English as its first language, during the 1940s a literary and intellectual movement formed in the Rhondda that would produce an influential group of Welsh language writers. Formed during the Second World War by Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths and his German wife Käte Bosse-Griffiths, the group was known as the Cadwgan Circle (Cylch Cadwgan), and met at the Griffiths' house in Pentre. The Welsh writers who made up the movement included Pennar Davies, Rhydwen Williams, James Kitchener Davies and Gareth Alban Davies.

Of the Cadwgan Circle, the most notable of their number is Rhydwen Williams, the winner of the Eisteddfod Crown on two occasions who used the landscape of the industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work. Writing in the English language Peter George was born in Treorchy and is best known as the Oscar nominated screenwriter of Dr. Strangelove, based on his book Red Alert. Reflecting the lives of the residents of the Rhondda, both Gwyn Thomas and Ron Berry brought a realism to the industrial valleys which was missing in the more rose-tinted writings of Richard Llewellyn.

Born and brought up in Llangeitho in Ceredigion, Davies spent his working life in the newly industrialised coalfields of the Rhondda Valley. The sometimes bleak conditions of his early life, especially as his early adulthood coincided with the economic despair of the depression, is reflected in his plays. Davies was part of the Cadwgan Circle, a literary group of likeminded writers from Rhondda, that centred their image of Wales on the new industrialised society they were brought up in. Members of the Circle included Rhydwen Williams, Pennar Davies and Gareth Alban Davies.

Griffiths' writing was influenced by the European avant-garde movement, especially that of Dadaist Kurt Schwitters. Griffiths, along with his wife, set up a writing and intellectual circle in the Rhondda for like-minded thinkers. The group, named the Cadwgan Circle (Cylch Cadwgan), had a membership of the finest writers in the Welsh language the Rhondda had ever produced, including Rhydwen Williams, Euros Bowen, Pennar Davies and J. Kitchener Davies.

Bosse left Germany for Britain and found research work at the Petrie Museum at the University College London and later at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. In 1938, while at Oxford, as a senior member of Somerville College she met fellow Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths. Griffiths, a Welsh and Classics scholar brought up in the Rhondda, was at that time a research student at Oxford, but the two of them returned to the Rhondda and made their home in the village of Pentre. They married in 1939 and Bosse became Käte Bosse-Griffiths. During the Second World War, Bosse-Griffiths and her husband set up the Cadwgan Circle from their home in Pentre, an avant-garde literary and intellectual group whose membership included Pennar Davies and Rhydwen Williams. Among these literary Welsh speakers Bosse-Griffiths found a love of the Welsh language. During the same years in Germany, Bosse-Griffiths's mother died at Ravensbrück, a notorious women's concentration camp. Her brothers Günther and Fritz were both imprisoned, and then served at Zöschen camp. An order to have them killed at the end of the war was not carried out. Her sister Dorothee was imprisoned for six weeks but released.

The industrialisation of parts of Wales was now beginning to be regarded as a mixed blessing, and the old agricultural agrarian way of life which persisted in most of the country was idealised by many writers. However, a more realistic picture of Gwynedd farming communities between the Wars was presented by John Ellis Williams (1924-) in both English and Welsh. Publication of these reminiscences appeared in community newspapers, the Countryman magazine and subsequently in paperback format in English under the titles of Clouds of Time and other Stories (1989) and Rare Welsh Bits (2000). A free spirit in the Welsh publishing circle, Williams was neither an academic nor a politician, but had embraced Existensialism in post Second World War France and had an active friendship and correspondence with Simone de Beauvoir. The 1940s also saw the creation of a notable writing group in the Rhondda, called the 'Cadwgan Circle'. Writing almost entirely in the Welsh language, the movement, formed by J. Gwyn Griffiths and his wife Käte Bosse-Griffiths, included the Welsh writers Pennar Davies, Rhydwen Williams, James Kitchener Davies and Gareth Alban Davies.

Randi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Genius award in 1986. The 5-year grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including W.V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his late-night TV show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealing personal information about her that he claims comes from God, and then performing a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. The information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who handed out "prayer cards" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Reverend Popoff would need to pray for them.

Nardwuar has also been known to be a "guerrilla journalist," often sneaking in to press conferences under the guise of a more normal reporter, to confront political leaders or other non-musical celebrities with surreal questions. He has asked Mikhail Gorbachev which world leader had the biggest pants, and Crispin Glover whether he owns a coffin full of tar. On another occasion, Nardwuar persistently asked faith healer Ernest Angley if there was a cure for "the Summertime Blues", to which Angley angrily replied, "Oh I wish you would shut up, man. You know you're not even funny. You're lucky God don't strike you dead."

By 1957, with Look firmly established and Gillard and Hawkins lobbying hard, the BBC management in London approved the official formation of a Natural History Unit. Gillard was on the search for a senior producer to head the new Unit, and asked David Attenborough to take on the role. Attenborough had good credentials (he was a trained zoologist) but declined, having recently settled in London with his young family. Instead, he was placed in charge of the newly-formed Travel and Exploration Unit, striking a deal which would allow him to continue to film his popular Zoo Quest (1954–1963) series alongside natural history output from the fledgling Bristol unit. The Travel and Exploration Unit in London also introduced viewers to more exotic wildlife, and made household names of the first natural history presenters. Armand and Michaela Denis filmed East African wildlife for their On Safari programmes, whilst another pioneering husband-and-wife team, Hans and Lottie Hass, created some of the first underwater films.

Christian television outlets in the U.S. usually broadcast in the UHF band. While there are many religious content providers for religious and faith-based television, there are few nationally recognized non-commercial television networks—funded by soliciting donations—such as Daystar Television Network (operated by Marcus Lamb and Joni Lamb) and Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) (operated by Paul Crouch and Jan Crouch). Unlike the larger religious network providers available to the mass public, many smaller religious organizations have a presence on cable television systems, either with their own channels (such as the 3ABN service) or by transmissions on public-access television (common for local congregations) or leased access channels. Religious programs are sometimes also transmitted on Sunday mornings by general commercial broadcasters not dedicated to religious programming.

At NBC, Ellerbee worked as a reporter on The Today Show. Her first anchor job was on the prime-time version of Weekend. Ellerbee joined Lloyd Dobyns as co-host of Weekend when the show moved from its late-night time slot (where it rotated with Saturday Night Live, generally one Saturday night per month) into direct prime time competition with CBS's 60 Minutes. As with the late-night incarnation, they would sign-off with the phrase, "And so it goes."  A couple of years later, Ellerbee was again teamed with Dobyns (and later Bill Schechner) as hosts of NBC News Overnight, where their trademark writing style made the show somewhat reminiscent of their stint on Weekend. They ended each broadcast with a short, usually wry, commentary, again signing off with the catch-phrase, "And so it goes," which later became the title of her first memoir. While at NBC, Ellerbee worked with Jessica Savitch; when Savitch's drug problems became apparent Ellerbee tried to organize an intervention, but Savitch died before that happened.

NBC News Overnight was the brainchild of NBC News president Reuven Frank, who conceived the show as inexpensive overnight programming after Late Night with David Letterman. Frank had created the news program Weekend in 1974, and the two programs shared a similar, sometimes ironic outlook on the news. Weekend's co-hosts Lloyd Dobyns and Linda Ellerbee were reunited for the program initially, though Bill Schechner replaced Dobyns in November 1982. Herb Dudnick was the program's first executive producer and was succeeded by Deborah B. Johnson.

The program was hosted by Lloyd Dobyns, who also did much of the reporting. The show's creator and executive producer was past (and future) president of NBC News, Reuven Frank.

Production was based in Washington, DC, with offices in the Tenley Circle area immediately east of NBC's Nebraska Avenue studios. Lloyd Dobyns, the shows host, appeared in a stark white modernistic set. In the absence of a theme composed especially for the show, producers opted to use the opening minute of "Piano Concerto No. 1 In D-Flat Major, Op. 10: I Allegro brioso" by Sergei Prokofiev, feeling that it added gravitas to the show—something they hoped would set them apart from ABC's lightweight 20/20.

NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft landed on Mars on Tuesday, July 20, 1976. Today mounted a three-hour special chronicling the landing. Lloyd Dobyns and Gene Shalit substituted for Hartz. NBC's Roy Neal reported from Viking mission control at JPL in Pasadena, California. Viking 1 touchdown took place within the show's first hour in the Eastern Time Zone. The first transmitted pictures began to trickle in during the 8:00 a.m. EDT hour. Dobyns, Neal and Shalit continued coverage into the 9:00 a.m. hour as more pictures and data streamed in. Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov were in attendance at JPL, and Neal conducted a live interview with both men shortly after touchdown.

Tarrant met his second wife Ingrid Dupre-Walsh when they both worked for TV-am. The couple married in 1991 and divorced in 2007 when it was revealed that Tarrant had a "close" relationship with Fiona McKechnie, a schoolteacher and co-patron for Headway. After a series of tabloid stories, on 18 September 2006 the couple announced that they were separating. The couple previously lived with their two children, daughter Sammy and son Toby in Esher, plus two children from Ingrid's previous marriage, Dexter and Fia, the latter a radio presenter with Reading 107 FM. Tarrant also has two children from a previous marriage to Sheila Tarrant, Helen and Jennifer. On 30 November 2006 Chris and Ingrid were interviewed separately on the Biography Channel and clips of it were shown on GMTV to talk about the downfall of their relationship. During this interview, Chris did not seem sorry about the break-up; he was quoted as saying, "Well, I was a naughty boy" and said about Ingrid, "She wouldn't trust me with a pint of milk"; however, in other interviews he showed clear remorse.

Osbourne was criticised for her outbursts on the show, where before a live show in series three she reportedly spoke out against Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? presenter Chris Tarrant, who was in the show's audience prior to filming. Tarrant had made a joke about Ozzy Osbourne to which Sharon Osbourne took offence, but most of her outburst focused on criticising Tarrant's recent infidelity to his wife Ingrid from whom he was in the process of separating. It was rumoured that Simon Cowell, fellow judge and creator of the show, was displeased with her performance in series three, and was thinking of replacing her and Louis Walsh for the next series. However, it was confirmed that Osbourne had been contracted to return for the fourth series of the show.

Following a ratings success, What Not to Wear was promoted to BBC One in 2004 to air its fourth series. The format was changed slightly, where a 30 minute show with one makeover was replaced by a 60 minute show featuring two makeovers. The series that aired for the first time on BBC One began on 29 September 2004, and had success with viewing figures which peaked at 5.26 million during the episode aired on 20 October 2004. For a Christmas special aired on 22 December 2004, Trisha Goddard was madeover by Constantine and Woodall, where the episode generated 7.42 million viewers. Other What Not to Wear specials saw them giving David Baddiel and Ingrid Tarrant makeovers. Tarrant however, did not wear what Constantine and Woodall had selected, and changed her dress in the back of the taxi whilst driving to the award ceremony. The fifth series began on 19 October 2005, where viewing figures still remained strong. On 16 November and 23, 2005 ratings reached 4.91 million and the series averaged with 4.8 million viewers. In 2005, Britney Spears revealed that she was a fan of the show where she commented "The girls are so dramatic in the makeovers, you just get caught up in it. Would I go on the show? Never say never.?"	Other What Not to Wear specials saw them giving David Baddiel and Ingrid Tarrant makeovers.	/m/02qkbl0	Ingrid_Tarrant	66	80	/people/person,/tv/tv_personality

Celebrity Coach Trip 1 was the first celebrity series of Coach Trip which was filmed from 6 to 17 September 2010 as is made clear from the reference from the Channel 4 website  and began showing on 8 November 2010. The series featured celebrity contestants and the tour lasted 10 days, filmed across 2 weeks. The pair who lasted to the end and are voted the most popular by the rest of the group received a £1000 prize for charity.

In 1927 Charles Lindbergh refused to include Vancouver in his North American tour because of the lack of a proper airport. Two years later the city purchased land on Sea Island for aviation purposes, replacing the original grass airstrip at Minoru Park. During World War II the airports and its original terminal, now the South Terminal, would be leased to the Federal government, and operated by the Department of National Defence and the Department of Transport. The airport was a base for Royal Canadian Air Force training, the crews and their families housed in a new townsite on the island, named Burkeville after Boeing president Stanley Burke. Funds from the lease were used to purchase additional land for new hangars and a production plant for Boeing Aircraft of Canada.

Henderson left the broadcast in 1959 and was succeeded by Earl Cameron, who had been presenter of the National News Bulletin on CBC's main radio service, the Trans-Canada Network, since 1944. Changes in the philosophy of CBC News led to Cameron, a professional announcer rather than a journalist, being replaced by journalist Stanley Burke, in 1966.

In 1959, Cameron succeeded Larry Henderson as the anchor of the CBC Television National News (today known as The National). During the 1960s, managers at CBC News moved towards a philosophy of regarding news announcers as journalists rather than performers. As part of this shift, the news service management put pressure on the announcers union to accept an agreement prohibiting news readers from commercials or accepting outside contracts with ad agencies. Cameron was personally pressured to terminate his outside announcing contracts reading commercials for products such as Crest toothpaste and Rambler automobiles and agreed in 1965 to give up his lucrative ad contracts. However, the next year, Cameron was dropped as the anchor of the National News, due to management's desire to have a professional journalist in the position of news anchor. Cameron was replaced by broadcast journalist Stanley Burke, although he continued as an announcer on CBC radio and television until his retirement in 1976. One of his duties was as the host of Viewpoint, a nightly five-minute programme which followed The National in which Cameron read letters from viewers.

The beaver is sometimes seen as another Canadian symbol, but is not necessarily specific to English Canadians. It too was used originally in connection with the Société St. Jean Baptiste before coming into currency as a more general Canadian symbol. In the 1973 political satire by Stanley Burke, Frog Fables & Beaver Tales, a spoof on Canadian politics of the Pierre Trudeau era, English Canadians are depicted in the main as well-meaning, but not terribly clever beavers (with other animals such as frogs, sea otters and gophers assigned to represent other linguistic and provincial populations). The historical relevance of the beaver stems from the early fur trade. It has been asserted that "he fur trade in general and the Hudson's Bay Company in particular exercised a profound influence on the sculpting of the Canadian soul."

Perkins announced that he was going to go home to his family and would be living in Washington, D.C., where he would go back to WTTG-TV, where he was previously a weather personality. He affectionately said to his young child on the air, "Connor, if you're watching, daddy's comin' home." Perkins was replaced by Mike Barz, former morning sports anchor for WGN-TV in Chicago.

RTÉ Radio 2, as it was originally known, began broadcasting on 31 May 1979. "Like Clockwork" by the Boomtown Rats was the first song on air, played by Larry Gogan. It was developed as a response by RTÉ to the pirate radio craze sweeping Dublin and the rest of the country. Its original slogan was "Radio 2 Comin'atcha" and, as well as broadcasting popular music, it carried a number of other musical strands as well as news and current affairs. Its original broadcast frequencies were 612 kHz MW (until 2004) and 90-92 MHz FM. Original DJs included some like Larry Gogan, Vincent Hanley and Jimmy Greeley who transferred from RTÉ Radio 1 and Mark Cagney who transferred from RTE Cork Local Radio. Most of the remaining deejays were recruited directly from the pirate stations, such as Michael McNamara, Declan Meehan, Ronan Collins, Gerry Ryan and Dave Fanning.

Early in his career, Ryan was involved part-time in pirate radio – presenting a selection of programmes firstly for Alternative Radio Dublin (ARD) and then for Big D. When Radio 2 (now RTÉ 2fm) was launched in 1979, Ryan joined RTÉ as a DJ where he presented a selection of speech- and music-based programmes, including Here Comes the Weekend on Friday nights and Saturday Scene on Saturday mornings, which earned him £78 per week. Ryan then moved to a night-time music show called 'Lights out' which accompanied Mark Cagney's grown-up album programme and Dave Fanning's The Rock Show as part of Radio 2's night-time line-up. The trio brought their shows on tour around Ireland. Ryan said they dressed as if they were in a band and behaved as such as well, booking into "awful hotels", drinking heavily and staying out late in "dodgy nightclubs". Their excessive talking has led to Ryan dubbing them "the three big-mouths on at night-time". They were good friends; Fanning was "a kind of hyperactive, Southside rock guru" and Cagney was "this obsessive, meticulous Corkman who would annotate every single millisecond of what he played on-air". The trio also started to put on live shows, some of which Ryan described as being attended by crowds of 20,000.

Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's chairman and former chief executive officer, first conceived of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. bureau chief of cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid growth in the number of cable television channels available in the U.S., and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with John D. Evans in 1977, who with a number of others helped to co-found the network. Early cable-TV executive Bob Rosencrans provided the initial funding of $25,000 for Lamb to initiate C-SPAN in 1979 and other cable-TV executives followed suit, eventually forming C-SPAN's first board of directors.

In an April 2009 interview with C-SPAN's Brian Lamb, Hitchens intimated that his friendship with Cockburn was still intact despite their disagreements. Hitchens mentioned that he had recently attended a Cockburn family wedding in which Alexander officiated, and that he and Cockburn used to see each other more frequently when they had both lived on the same coast of the United States. In the same interview, Lamb and Hitchens discussed Cockburn's scathing remarks about Hitchens criticisms of Said and Sheehan. Hitchens felt the intervening years had justified his criticisms of Sheehan, and expressed that "it's beneath Alexander to be defending someone as cheap and demagogic as her". In the case of Hitchens' criticisms of Said on his death bed, Hitchens replied, "It's actually rather silly of Alexander to say that...he's often written counter-obituaries of people who have been overpraised and has chosen precisely the moment when there's a lot of sentimental garbage being published to say, 'come on, this guy wasn't so great!' " Following Hitchens' death in 2011, Cockburn wrote a critical obituary of him for Counterpunch.
