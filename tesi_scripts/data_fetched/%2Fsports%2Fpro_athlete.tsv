Like the All Blacks, Munster have played Australia many times. They first met in 1947, where Australia won 6–5. Munster claimed their first victory over the Wallabies in 1967, when they won 11–8. In 1992, Australia, reigning world champions, having won the 1991 Rugby World Cup, visited Munster as part of a European Tour. Munster won 22–19 in a rough encounter in Cork. Ten years later, London newspaper The Daily Telegraph recounted part of the legend in a feature on Munster prop Peter Clohessy: "The then Wallabies coach, Bob Dwyer, who was not a man who readily accepted that opposition sides could legitimately score more points than his team, immediately branded the Munster Number 3 a 'disgrace'. It had been a typically rugged, robust and memorable Munster triumph, with leather and fists flying on both sides. Clohessy, who wouldn't generally be known for misconduct, was no more guilty than the next man but world champions are not supposed to lose against a hastily assembled Irish provincial XV. There had to be a reason, an excuse, and Dwyer rounded on Clohessy".

Cork went into decline following this defeat and fve years past before Kelleher added a sixth and final Munster title to his collection. Because of a delay in the championship the 5-1 to 3-1 defeat of Tipperary allowed Cork to advance to the All-Ireland final. Arch-rivals Kilkenny provided the opposition again.

A 6-6 to 2-4 defeat of Laois gave Rochford a seventh provincial winners' medal. Yet another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, with Cork providing the opposition once again. The game was an extremely close affair with Sim Walton proving himself to be the goal-scoring hero. A speculative Matt Gargan shot also hopped past the goalkeeper to give Kilkenny a narrow 2-1 to 1-3 victory. It was Rochford's sixth All-Ireland winners' medal.

However, these younger players were largely inexperienced for championship football and came up short against a Dublin team determined to win the Championship outright.

While Kilkenny dominated the early 1970s, the second part of the decade belonged to Cork. 1976 saw Cork win a second consecutive Munster title, allowing the team to advance directly to the All-Ireland final where Wexford provided the opposition. Both sides had high expectations. Cork got off to the worst possible start in an All-Ireland final and trailed by 2-2 after six minutes. 'The Rebels' battled back, however, the game hung in the balance for much of the seventy.

Moments later, following another intervention by Foley, Wexford struck for their second goal. The sliothar was moved up the field where it was caught by Tom Ryan. Ryan passed the sliothar to Nicky Rackard who made no mistake in sending it into the Cork net past goalkeeper Mick Cashman. This score, which clinched the game for Wexford, was quickly followed by the final score of the game, a point for Wexford by Tom Dixon.

The Lassies posted a 46-66 record in their first year, and placed sixth in the eight-team league. They improved to 69-43 in 1947, to win a close pennant race with the Grand Rapids Chicks. Muskegon was led by OF/P Doris Sams, who ranked in several offensive categories and also collected 11 victories, including a perfect game, good enough to win the Most Valuable Player Award. Notably, the team counted with three of the top four pitchers in earned run average, Sams (0.98), Amy Irene Applegren (1.06) and Nancy Warren (1.13), but lost to the Racine Belles in the best-of-five, first-round matchup 3-1.

In 1950 the AAGPBL was losing money and fans, and the teams and host cities were changing almost every year. This was a good thing for Kalamazoo as the city was granted the Muskegon Lassies team on a trial basis when the city of Muskegon could no longer support them. The move took place in the middle of the season and the new Kalamazoo Lassies played their first game, still in their Muskegon uniforms, on 15 June 1950 at Lindstrom Field. About 1,400 fans attended the game, which was won by the defending league champion Rockford Peaches, 8–2. The new Lassies posted their first victory the next night, a 10–2 rout of Rockford led by pitcher Doris Sams and player-manager Bonnie Baker. The Lassies combined for a 36-73 record that year and finished in the cellar.

The Colleens and Sallies played exhibition games and recruited new talent as they toured through the South and East. Highlights of these tours included contests at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. and Yankee Stadium in New York. Alderfer played for them in 1949 (Sallies) and 1950 (Coleens). She was drafted again by the Lassies after moving to Kalamazoo in 1951, but her mother took ill and she decided to stay home and care for her. Alderfer believed the toughest pitcher she faced was Doris Sams and the best player she saw in action was Dottie Schroeder. Playing baseball and being paid for having fun was great. Also traveling to different cities and meeting a lot of different people. My teammates were the greatest., she recalled.

Cordes also appeared in the 1952 midseason All-Star Game as a member of the All-Star Team, which faced the South Bend Blue Sox, the league’s 1951 playoff champions. The All-Stars prevailed, 7–6, when Betty Foss scored the eventual winning run on an RBI-single by Doris Sams in the top of the 9th inning. Then Cordes retired South Bend in the bottom of the ninth to earn the save. Kalamazoo improved to a 49-61 record in that season.

Voyce continued to improve in 1948, ending with 52 RBI, 46 runs, 99 hits and a .227 average in 126 games. In 1949, in a pitching dominated league, she hit .257 (0.021 behind champion bat Doris Sams) with three home runs and 53 RBI while scoring 51 runs in 113 games. She shared the home run title with Thelma Eisen and Audrey Wagner and finished second in RBI. The defending champion Chicks won the first round of the playoffs but lost in the semi-finals.

In 1952, Foss received the highest honor of the league when she earned the Player of the Year Award. She led all batters in runs (81), hits (137), doubles (26), triples (17) and RBI (74), and was second in stolen bases (80), while hitting a solid .331 in 106 games to finish second in the batting race behind her sister Joanne (.344). Her 17 triples (more than the next two players combined) is a single-season record. Finally, she gained her first All-Star selection at first base. The All-Star team faced the South Bend Blue Sox, the league’s 1951 playoff champions. The All-Stars prevailed, 7–6, when Foss scored the eventual winning run on an RBI-single by Doris Sams in the top of the 9th inning.

In 1947, according to a new regulation, all AAGPBL pitchers were forced to switch from underhand to sidearm. Such change adversely affected the performance of underhand pitchers, but it did not disturbed Earp, because she had developed a blazing fastball and a dropping curveball, showing a good command of her pitches. Earp enjoyed a superb first season, as she posted a 20–8 record for a .714 winning percentage in 35 pitching appearances; collecting a minuscule 0.68 ERA and striking out 192 while walking just 32 in 280 innings of work. Her 0.68 ERA was a new single-season record, though Lois Florreich would set a 0.67 ERA in 1949 to reach the all-time mark. Earp, who led a formidable Chicks pitching staff that included Alice Haylett (19–11) and Connie Wisniewski (16–14), finished second in strikeouts to Fort Wayne's Dorothy Collins (244), second in winning percentage to Muskegon's Doris Sams (.733), and made her first and only All-Star Team. With Johnny Rawlings at the helm, Grand Rapids finished in second place with a 65–47 record; dispatched South Bend in the first round of the playoffs, and defeated Racine in the final series, four to three games, to clinch the AAGPBL Championship Title. Earp was the heroine of the final. Even though she lost Game 1, 2–0, in 11 innings after retiring the first 21 Belles batters, she rebounded to win Game 4 on a 3–0 shutout, and then pitched a four-hit, 1–0 shutout to win decisive Game 7. In five postseason decisions, Earp went 1–1 with a 1.13 ERA against South Bend, and 2–1, 0.62 against Racine.	Earp, who led a formidable Chicks pitching staff that included Alice Haylett (19–11) and Connie Wisniewski (16–14), finished second in strikeouts to Fort Wayne's Dorothy Collins (244), second in winning percentage to Muskegon's Doris Sams (.733), and made her first and only All-Star Team.	/m/0bxzm7k	Doris_Sams	228	238	/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete
Wisniewski continued to terrorize opposing pitchers throughout the 1949 season. She posted a solid .278 average, losing the batting crown to Muskegon Lassies' Doris Sams by one percentage point. Wisniewski also collected 113 hits, 64 runs, and 32 RBI, and amassed 140 total bases, even though she did not hit a home run. She was second in hits (one behind Sams), runs and total bases, ranking third in doubles (13) and tying for fifth in triples (7). In addition, she was selected for the All-Star Team. During the playoffs, the Chicks beat Fort Wayne (2-1) in the first round and lost to Rockford (3-1) in the semi-finals.

In Kalamazoo, with cold weather around 40 degrees and windy, both teams’ managers agreed to play the Game 2 in just seven innings. Risinger started for the Chicks and pitched one of the best games of her career. Grand Rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning, and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth, keyed by a two-run double off the bat of Ricketts. Risinger gave up a RBI single to Jean Lovell, and yielded only one extra-base hit, a solo home run by Doris Sams during Kalamazoo's two-run rally in the sixth inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Lassies tried to rally again. Fern Shollenberger opened with a single, but Risinger retired the next two batters. Nevertheless, she lost her control temporarily and issued back-to-back walks to Schroeder and Peppas. With the bases loaded, Woody English was on the verge of yanking Risinger, but he instead sent Ziegler to the pitching mound. Pulling off her glove, the 5 ft 3 in (1.60 m) Ziegler looked up at the tall Risinger. Okay, Beansie, can you get her out? she asked. Blowing on her hand to keep her fingers warm against the fast-chilling night, the pitcher replied, I don't know Ziggy. Snapping the brim of her cap in place, the diminutive Ziegler energetically ordered, Well do it! As a result, Risinger faced the dangerous Sams and struck out her on three straight fastballs. She fanned nine Lassies batters and walked four in completing her pitching gem.

In her last season, Faut led all pitchers in ERA for the fourth year in a row and tied for the most wins with Eleanor Moore of Grand Rapids, who went 17–7 with a 2.00 ERA. In addition, Faut topped the league with 143 strikeouts to win the Triple Crown pitching for a second time. She also finished third in shutouts (5), seventh in innings (226), and tied for the third in complete games (24). On September 3 of that year, she hurled a perfect game against the Kalamazoo Lassies, 4–0, to become the only pitcher in the league's history to throw two perfect games. She helped herself with the bat as well, hitting a solid .275 (87-for-316) with 11 doubles, one triple, and a career-high four home runs, while driving in 38 runs and scoring 33 times in 98 games. In addition, she was included in the All-Star team for the fourth time, and once again won the Player of the Year honors, although South Bend finished fifth and missed the playoffs. Making that, she joined Doris Sams as the only two-time Player of the Year winners in AAGPBL history.

In 1952 Stoll topped the .300 mark for the first time, hitting .301 with 45 and 60 RBI, though she appeared in only 86 games. South Bend finished second (64-45) in the six-team league, but dissension within the Blue Sox peaked just before the season ended, when infielder Pryer was disciplined following a dispute with manager Karl Winsch. In support of Pryer, five South Bend teammates, including Mahon and Stoll, joined her in a walkout, leaving Winsch's team short-handed for the playoffs with only twelve players. Nonetheless, South Bend beat Grand Rapids in two games and later defeated Rockford in five games, to win a second consecutive title in the league. Stoll played with the Kalamazoo Lassies for the rest of her career. Her most productive season came in 1953, when she hit a career-high .308 with 38 runs in 110 games and also posted career numbers in at-bats (396), hits (122) and RBI (65), being selected for the All-Star Team. In the end, Kalamazoo finished in third place with 56-50 mark and advanced to the playoffs, thanks to an improved lineup boosted by a good mixture of veteran players like Doris Sams, Dorothy Schroeder, Fern Shollenberger and the newcomer Stoll, along with younger players like Jean Lovell and Nancy Mudge. Gloria Cordes and June Peppas were the top pitchers of the team. In the first round, Kalamazoo beat Fort Wayne in three games, but was swept in two games by Grand Rapids in the final series.

In April 1947, all of the league’s players were flown to Havana, Cuba, for spring training. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in Havana because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. City ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their exhibition games in Havana than did the Dodgers. Maguire saw little action with the Lassies that year, but still to manage a .216 average with 28 runs and 24 RBI in just 75 games due to an injury. Muskegon improved considerably under new manager, Bill Wambsganss, to win a close pennant race with a fine 69–43 record, backed by a strong performance from outfielder/pitcher Doris Sams, who hit a third-best .280 average with 31 runs and 41 RBI in 107 games, and posted a 11–4 pitching record with a respectable 0.93 earned run average, to finish second only to Grand Rapids' Mildred Earp (.068). Sams was named Player of the Year, but Muskegon fell in the first round of the playoffs, dropping 3 of 4 games to Racine.

By 1944 the AAGPBL added two teams, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes. Ziegler attended a tryout for the AAGPBL arranged by scout Bill Allington, who would join the league for the upcoming season as manager of the Rockford team. Ziegler was one of six girls from Los Angeles who traveled to Peru, Indiana for the tryout. The girls passed the test and were rewarded with a contract to play in the league. Ziegler joined the Chicks, along with Thelma Eisen, while Faye Dancer, Annabelle Lee, Lavonne Paire and Dorothy Wiltse were allocated to the Millerettes.

Kellogg entered the AAGPBL in 1944 with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes. She hit a .202 batting average in 111 games, including 46 runs batted in while scoring 20 runs. The Millerettes, managed by former major leaguer Bubber Jonnard, compiled the worst mark of the league (45–72) and finished last in both halves of the season, 8½ games back of fifth place overall, 26½ out of first. The team did have some good performances from Helen Callaghan and Faye Dancer, two of the top batters in the league, while the pitching staff was led by Dorothy Wiltse, who posted a 20–16 record with a 1.88 earned run average (fourth in the league), and Annabelle Lee, who finished 11–14 with a 2.43 ERA and hurled the first perfect game in the league's history. Due to the lack of fan support and close competition, the Millerettes folded at the end of the season and were replaced by the Fort Wayne Daisies in 1944.

Haines opened 1945 with the Fort Wayne Daisies, who replaced the Minneapolis team. The Daisies, with Bill Wambsganss at the helm, was a talented squad that included in their roster players as the sisters Helen and Marge Callaghan, Faye Dancer, Vivian Kellogg, Ruth Lessing and Pepper Paire. Haines improved in a most positive environment as part of a top three pitching rotation that included Annabelle Lee and Dorothy Wiltse, going 16-10 with a 2.46 ERA in 33 decisions. She finished sixth in the league with a .615 winning percentage and tied for eight in wins. In addition, she hurled her second career no-hitter on June 15, in a rain-shortened, six-inning game.

Two defensive open-field kicks were attempted on the same play by the Toronto Argonauts on October 29, 2010, against the Montreal Alouettes. With 9 seconds remaining and the game tied at 30–30, Montreal's Damon Duval attempted a 36-yard field goal but missed. After Argonaut kicker Noel Prefontaine leaped into the air to keep the ball in bounds before it could exit the back of the end zone for the single, his teammate Mike Bradwell scooped up the ball and then kicked it out to about the 20-yard line. There it was caught by Duval, who immediately kicked it back to the end zone to attempt a single. Prefontaine seemed ready to reply with his own catch-and-kick, but Argo linebacker and backup punter Grant Shaw stepped in front of him, muffed the catch, and attempted to kick the loose ball out of the end zone. This fourth kick of the play failed to clear the end zone. Montreal's Dahrran Diedrick eventually gained possession of the ball for a touchdown.

The Irish Independent sports star of the week, selected by newspaper sports staff, was traditionally accorded to a camogie player once each year on the week of the All Ireland final. Annual Cúchulainn All Star awards were introduced as part of the first Gaelic Weekly All-star awards scheme, initiated by a group of sportswriters led by Mick Dunne and awarded on the same selectorial basis as the Gaelic football and hurling all stars are today, though without a major sponsor. They were awarded to two camogie players in 1964-7, reduced to one in 1968-9. The camogie selectors for 1964 were Maeve Gilroy, Kathleen Mills and Lil O’Grady and those of 1965 were Kathleen O'Duffy, Síghle Nic an Ultaigh and Eithne Neville. In the 1970s the GAA Player of the month scheme, awarded one of its monthly awards, usually in November, to a camogie player. The scheme, initiated by sports journalist and historian David Guiney and also selected by sportswriters, became an effective player of the year award under three successive sponsors, B+I Line, Irish Nationwide and Eircell. The camogie player of the year was revived as part of the Powerscreen all star award scheme in and an official player of the year award was introduced in 2005.

Despite the scoreline the final must rank with the greatest and most brilliant camogie matches ever played. Three early goals by their flying full forward Judy Doyle in the first seven minutes of the game proved the really vital factor in Dublin’s victory. Those early goals, all the result of crafty team-work by the experienced Dublin attack, hung heavy on the minds of the Antrim forwards for the rest of the first half. Although with the fresh breeze behind them, they had by far the greater number of chances, they often shot too hurriedly and too wildly and Concepta Clarke saved magnificently when they did shoot straight. The result was that, at the interval, Antrim had one point on the board and nine wides, while Dublin, thanks to that wonderful zig-zag solo run and flashing shot by captain Una O’Connor, and a rare piece of opportunism by Bríd Keenan, had stretched their goal total to five and their lead to fourteen points by the half-time whistle. Lesser teams than Antrim might well have accepted defeat at that stage, but the girls in saffron, having switched Lily Scullion to midfield and Maeve Gilroy to centre-forward, restarted as though the game had just begun.

2006 saw Cork turn their attentions to a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1978. The team's championship campaign got off to a good start with a 0-20 to 0-14 defeat of Clare in the opening round of the Munster championship. Deane gave a superb display that day as he score ten points. The subsequent provincial decider saw Cork take on Tipp for the second consecutive year. Once again Deane was to the fore, scoring an impressive eight points and contributing greatly to Cork's 2-11 to 1-11 victory over their old rivals. Subsequent victories over Limerick and Waterford saw Cork qualify for their fourth consecutive All-Ireland final and for the third time Kilkenny were the opponents. Like previous encounters neither side took a considerable lead, however, Kilkenny had a vital goal from Aidan Fogarty.

Keevy began playing club rugby at around the age of sixteen, his main club being Brakpan RFC. By 1942, at province level, he was representing the Orange Free State, remaining with them until 1945 when he switched to Eastern Transvaal. He trialed for the 1949 South Africa tour of New Zealand, and again for the 1951-52 tour of Great Britain, Ireland and France, for which he was successful.

For the first two seasons the driver did not need to finish the race in order to collect points, but did have to start. However in 2010 a driver needs to start and finish the race in order to score. The same points are awarded for Race 1 as Race 2, despite Race 2 having a reverse grid with the slowest given the advantage at the front. In 2009 began the running of a third race, a 'Super Final', at the end of certain weekends, however no points were awarded this race. As a result, the maximum number of points any football club/driver could score in one round during 2008 or 2009 was 100, by winning both main races. This feat wasn't achieved although Sébastien Bourdais, Craig Dolby, Robert Doornbos and Max Wissel all scored 90 points in a weekend by finishing either 2nd and 2nd or 1st and 3rd.

The race began with a rolling start, to eradicate a potential chink in the 750bhp car's armour, and would also delay the introduction of pitstops until the next round. From the start, the Olympiacos car of Kasper Andersen got a fantastic run from fourth on the grid, and was alongside Rigon as the grid headed for Redgate. However, he ran wide and fell back to fourth behind García and a fast-starting Yelmer Buurman in the PSV Eindhoven car. This would become fifth by the end of the lap, as Duncan Tappy also got by, in the Tottenham Hotspur machine. The safety car was deployed on lap three, as A.C. Milan and CR Flamengo had both gone off at Coppice with engine failures on the first and third laps respectively. There were further problems down the field with a midfield incident between Philippe and Andy Soucek in the SC Corinthians car and both would later retire from the race. Enrico Toccacelo would also become a factor in the race, having started sixth in the A.S. Roma car, moving up to third which became second, as García had to shift to manual gear-shifting after developing a problem on down-shifts. Toccacelo did get to within a second and a half of Rigon, but the Italian in the Chinese team's car would hold on, to be the first race-winner of the series. Toccacelo finished 2nd, while Tappy just held off Buurman for the final podium spot. Star of the race though, fell to Adrián Vallés. Having missed qualifying due to an electrical problem, the Liverpool F.C. car charged through from 17th on the grid, to finish fifth ahead of the other finishers Zuber, Tristan Gommendy (F.C. Porto), Ryan Dalziel (Rangers F.C.), Max Wissel (FC Basel 1893) and the troubled García.

Here - in a new venue Bath - the Rugby League winger reached his Superstars highpoint, dominating Davies, pentathlete Jim Fox and new challenger Andy Ripley from Rugby Union with a strong all-round performance. He had his share of luck (water skier Mike Hazelwood was tied in first place in the shooting when he mis-fired the decisive shot, gifting 10 points to Fielding) but he was on top form this season. He had every reason to believe he had a strong chance in both International and World Superstars later that year, but - as so often in Superstars - he could not hold his form; the ever increasing levels of competition saw him lose, first to a resurgent Ripley in the second International, then to a motor-oil powered Jody Schekter in the 1981 World Final. Again, Fielding would never win another Superstars event. The curse of the European champions seemed to be holding strong.

However the 1970s would bring Pontypridd its first period of real success. Following the redevelopment of the A470 trunk road near their home ground, the team moved to its current home of Sardis Road in Pontypridd in 1974. This move was immediately followed by success in the unofficial league championship, winning it in 1975/76, 1977/78 and 1978/79 whilst never falling from the top four for seven years under the captaincy of two of Pontypridd's greatest ever players – Bob Penberthy and Tommy David.

Balbergbakken or Balbergbakkene was a ski jumping hill complex located at Fåberg in Lillehammer, Norway. The centerpiece consisted of a large hill with a construction point of 120 meters (390 ft) (K-120), in addition to three smaller K-40, K-25 and K-15 hills. The venue was opened in 1972, having cost slightly more than one million Norwegian krone (NOK) after significant cost overruns. Balbergbakken hosted three Norwegian Championships, in 1973, 1978 and 1983, and a FIS Ski Jumping World Cup in 1984. The hill record of 130.5 meters was set by Tom Levorstad in 1981. It was planned that the venue would be used for the 1994 Winter Olympics, but because of lack of infrastructure, the new Lysgårdsbakken was built instead. Balbergbakken was closed in 1992.

The hill was used for 31 tournaments, of which six had to be cancelled because of wind or snow conditions.

A FIS Ski Jumping World Cup race was held on 9 March 1984. It saw Pavel Ploc win ahead of Matti Nykänen and Ernst Vettori. The event drew 5,000 spectators. The World Cup race incurred a large loss, with the organizers only covering half of the NOK 260,000 it cost to host. The hill record was set by Tom Levorstad in 1981, who reached 130.5 meters. The final race was scheduled to be the 1992 Junior Norwegian Championships, but they were canceled because of lack of snow.

Public education was entrusted to the religious establishment of the region, which since 1821 had only Russian archbishops. Dimitrie Sulima (Archbishop in 1821–1855), and Antonie Shokotov (1855–1871) allowed the parallel usage of both Romanian and Russian in church, and did not take any measures to infringe upon the linguistic specifics of the region. With the appointment of Pavel Lebedev (1871–1882), the situation changed radically, and the language of the locals was soon purged from the church. To prevent the printing of religious literature in Romanian, Lebedev closed down the printing press in Chişinău, collected from the region and burned the already printed books in Romanian (in Slavonic Cyrillic alphabet). The following archbishops Sergey Lapidevsky, Isakyi Polozensky, Neofit Novodchikov eased some of Lebedev's measures to help quell the serious dissatisfaction of the population. The next Archbishop Iakov Pyatnitsky (1898–1904) discovered that his desire to popularize a Christian culture and a moral education faced a language barrier, and in 1900 convinced the Russian High Synod to allow the publication of religious pamphlets in Romanian, while his follower Archbishop Vladimir allowed the printing of books, and from 1908 even of a regular religious journal "Luminătorul" by Constantin Popovici and Gurie Grosu. The last Russian Archbishops, Serafim Chichyagov (1908–1914), Platon (1914–1915) and Atanasy (1915–1918) tried to preserve the privileged status of the Russian language in the church in Bessarabia, but did not introduce any new anti-Romanian measures. Left by the last Russian Archbishop on June 23, 1918, the archbishopric was entrusted to the Bishop Nicodem de Huşi from Romania, who appointed a local Archbishop Dionisie Erhan. Then the Clerical Congress on February 21, 1920 elected Gurie Botoşăneanu as the highest church official in Bessarabia, which afterwards was restored from Archbishop to Metropolitan.

In 1999 Eric Tillman returned to the club as GM after spending a year in television. He hired Offensive Coordinator Jim Barker to replace Don Matthews as Head Coach. Injuries riddled the Argonauts early, but the league’s best defence helped the club fight to another 9–9 record. The team would qualify for the playoffs but lost to the eventual champions Hamilton Tiger-Cats 27–6. Linebacker Mike O'Shea became the first Argo player to win the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award. On December 20, 1999, New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz was named the ninth owner in the history of the Argonauts franchise. Schwarz named J. I. Albrecht as the managing director and John Huard as the 37th head coach in Argonauts history. This season also saw the retirement of two Argo all-time greats as receiver Paul Masotti retired in May as the team's all-time leading receiver, and on September 15, Michael Clemons went straight from cleats to the coaching ranks as he retired to take over the coaching reins from a fired Huard after a 1–6–1 start. The team responded to their former teammate and the Argos battled to a 6–4 record the rest of the way, just missing out on a playoff berth after finishing the season with a 7–11–1 record.

Clemons became head coach of the Toronto Argonauts upon ending his playing career on September 15 of the 2000 CFL season replacing John Huard who resigned as head coach of the team after compiling a 1–6–1 record. When offered the head coaching job by team general manager J. I. Albrecht, he was reluctant to accept it, wanting to spend more time with his family. According to Clemons, "it was an awkward situation. After saying no, they said do us the favour of going home and discussing it with your family. The burden was that this team, this organization, had given our family so much that Canada was going to be our home. The Argos had everything to do with my family becoming a part of this country. Because of all I had been given I decided it was my time to reciprocate." After his playing in his last game, Clemons coached the Argos to 6 wins out of their remaining 8 games. In November, 2001, he was promoted to President of the Argonauts and relinquished his role as head coach in the process to Gary Etcheverry.

In 1943 the senior hurling championship faced a number of problems. Chief amongst these was the fact that the Emergency forced the All-Ireland minor and junior to be cancelled, resulting in the Ulster teams having no hurling competition. Because of this the Ulster champions were allowed to participate in the All-Ireland senior championship for the first time since 1925. That year Armstrong collected his second Ulster title before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final. That game, played at Corrigan Park in Belfast, threw up a surprise result as Antrim defeated Galway by 7-0 to 6-2. This allowed Armstrong’s side to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kilkenny and, once again, the game was played at Corrigan Park. It was another historic win for Antrim as ‘the Cats’ were defeated by 3-3 to 1-6. It was the biggest shock in the history of the All-Ireland championship. For the first time in history a team from Ulster qualified to play in the All-Ireland final. Cork, the champions of the previous two years, provided the opposition on this unique occasion. Before the game the economic realities of the time surfaced. Jimmy Walsh, the Antrim captain presented a quantity of butter to the Cork captain, Seán Condon, who in turn presented his counterpart with a quantity of tea. Once the pre-match festivities were over the game began and a rout ensued. Cork crushed Antrim by 5-16 to 0-4, one of the biggest deficits in the history of the championship.

In 1971 they were knocked out easily by an Alan Joyce-coached East Fremantle outfit, but in 1972 they lost only three home-and-away games and with players of the calibre of Graham Moss, Bruce Duperouzel, Colin Tully and Daryl Griffiths, were firm flag favourites, only to be beaten in both the second semi and grand finals by a more physical East Perth side. Despite recruiting Essendon full forward Geoff Blethyn, the Tigers fell to last in 1973 with only four wins, and did even worse in 1975 with only three wins as Moss went to Essendon. The club were involved in an unusual incident in their Round 20 clash against West Perth during the 1976 season. Claremont coach Mal Brown replaced John Colreavy with Ross Ditchburn at three-quarter time, but when another player went off injured in the last quarter, Brown sent Colreavy back onto the ground, in contravention of the rule which specified that a player being replaced could not return to the field. Claremont lost the game 20.21 (141) to 13.18 (96), but had their score annulled after the game. When Moss returned in 1977 as captain-coach, he gradually moulded one of the most individually talented teams in WAFL history with such players as Jim and Phil Krakouer, Ken Hunter, Wayne Blackwell, John Annear, and Warren Ralph. In 1981 they kicked an Australian record 3,352 points in 21 matches, and won their fifth flag over an inaccurate South Fremantle. Despite lacking the “enforcer” needed to win many flags under pressure, between 1979 and 1994 Claremont played in the finals every year bar 1985 and 1992, and under Gerard Neesham’s extremely innovative coaching methods and “chip and draw” style, they won twenty and drew one of their last 21 games in 1987. Neesham’s skill was such that Claremont reached five successive grand finals for three flags despite the loss of most key players to the VFL (later AFL).

In 2012, rumors started that Andretti Autosport would expand to NASCAR Sprint Cup Series competition in 2013. Jayski.com stated that Andretti Autosport would field a single car team in the Cup Series in 2013 with Dodge as the manufacturer. Two days later, Dodge reported that there was no deal with Andretti or any team for the 2013 Season. In addition to Patrick being replaced by Hinchcliffe, Mike Conway was not brought back for the 2012 season, leaving the team with three full time cars. Two additional drivers, Sebastián Saavedra and Ana Beatriz were signed for three and two races respectively, including the Indy 500. With Honda no longer the sole engine supplier for the series, a deal was reached with Chevrolet to provide engines for the team. The team's three drivers qualified second, third and fourth for the 500, however the race itself proved a disappointment with only Hinchcliffe completing the full 200 laps, finishing sixth. The eighth race of the season at the Milwaukee Mile would be won by Hunter-Reay, his third podium finish of the year. Hunter-Reay would go on to win three races in a row, adding victories at Iowa and Toronto. A fourth victory in the second to last race of the season at Baltimore left Hunter-Reay as the only challenger to Will Power for the series championship. Power, whose title had seemed inevitable after dominating the road and street courses early in the season, still had a 17 point lead. On lap 66, with Power and Hunter-Reay racing side by side, Power spun, narrowly hitting Hunter-Reay, and went hard into the outer wall. Hunter-Reay would finish in fourth to win the championship.

In international IIHF rules, European professional leagues, some lower-level North American professional leagues (ECHL and Central Hockey League), and most amateur leagues worldwide, play is stopped for icing immediately once the puck crosses the goal line. This is called automatic or no-touch icing. This rule has been adopted after an incident in the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League in 1990, when Luděk Čajka, rushing to get to the puck in an icing situation, crashed into the boards, suffered severe spinal injuries, and died a few weeks later.

In 1880, now a freshman at Peterhouse College, Tait was selected for the Cambridge University team. At the end of the year Tait was part of the Cambrisge team to face Oxford University in the annual Varsity Match, now played at Blackheath. This was Tait's first sporting 'Blue', and the game ended in a respectful draw. Tait missed the 1881 game, but was back in the team for the 1882, led by fellow Peterhouse student Herbert Fuller. The game was won by Oxford, thanks to a clever try scored by Alan Rotherham.

D'Aguilar played rugby for the Royal Engineers within the army and made his international debut on 5 February 1872 in front of 4,000 spectators at The Oval in the England vs Scotland match. This was the second time the teams had met and in fact the second international match, as well as being the first time England had hosted an international rugby match. England won the match, a reversal of the previous year's result in Scotland. In this 1872 meeting Scotland opened the scoring with a drop goal from Cathcart. England responded through Hamersley touching down for a try. In itself, the try was not worth any points, but afforded England a "try at goal" and this was converted by Francis Isherwood. England then scored a dropgoal from the boot of Freeman in the second half. England continued to dominate and Francis d'Aguilar himself scored a try but Isherwood failed to convert d'Aguilar's try, thus no points were scored. Finney's try for England was also not converted. However, England prevailed by two goals to one, with two extra tries. Shortly after his international appearance he was posted to India and spent much of his life there. He did return to England in the early part of the 1880s and on his return played for Bath as well as Somerset. His participation for Bath made him the earliest international to play for Bath, though he had already been capped when he joined them. Thus, Herbert Fuller who represented England in 1882 remains Bath's first international whilst playing for the club.

A number of sources suggest that Francis and his brother John were the first brothers to appear together in a rugby international, in the very first international in 1871. However, this is a misconception because Francis Luscombe did not play in that very first international, though his brother did. Prior to the first international and also before the foundation of the Rugby Football Union, Francis Luscombe had not only established himself as a formidable rugby forward, but had also been instrumental in the creation of the Gipsies Football Club. It was founded in October 1868, by three Old Tonbridgians, Francis Luscombe, J. A. Body, and W. J. Parker. These three men were keen on football and wanted to provide a football club in London with which Tonbridge's former pupils could affiliate, much as the Marlborough Nomads served Marlborough College. These three soon recruited a number of likeminded individuals and in the summer of 1868 they were able to arrange a card of matches for the season 1868-69. After the two first matches had been played a meeting was called on 17 October 1868 and "The Gipsies Football Club" was formed with Francis Luscombe elected as honorary secretary. The team was based in Peckham. and was unbeaten in its first season (with 7 matches won and 11 drawn) and in the next season, 1869–70, the club continued its good form playing 18 out of which they drew 13, won 3 and lost just 2. Among the many opponents attracted to play the team were Blackheath FC, Richmond FC, Oxford and Cambridge Universities, Ravenscourt Park, Marlborough Nomads, Woolwich, Sandhurst, Cooper's Hill, St. Andrew's Rovers, Clapham Rovers, and West Kent. Such was the reputation of the club, that on 26 January 1871, the Gipsies were one of the twenty-one London and suburban football clubs that followed Rugby School rules that assembled at the Pall Mall Restaurant in Regent Street and formed the Rugby Football Union was formed. Francis Luscombe was not only present but also became one of the thirteen original committee members. The first instance of the RFU trialing its laws was in 1871 in a match between the Football Company and Harlequins FC. Francis Luscombe, who along with John Bentley had been instrumental in founding the Football Company, played in that match. It is interesting to note that the Football Company adopted the all white strip of Rugby School, and following this match it was decided that England should also wear white.

The torpedo system is an ice hockey on-ice system first used by the Swedish team Djurgårdens IF. The coach of Djurgårdens IF, Hardy Nilsson, took the system with him and it was used extensively by the Swedish national hockey team in international competition. The system converts the traditional hockey layout of three forwards and two defensemen, into two torpedoes up front, two halfbacks, and one lone defenceman (or libero). The torpedoes are responsible for forechecking in the corners when the puck is in the offensive zone, and stay around the neutral zone to be sprung into a scoring position (by a stretch pass or torpedo pass). The halfbacks are all-purpose players that run the offense from the faceoff circles in the offensive zone, and defend against the other team's torpedoes. The libero protects the rear of the ice.

The Raiders, looking to build on their strong finish to the 2010 season in 2011, bolstered its already strong roster with the addition of Blake Ferguson, Brett White and former Dally M medalist Matt Orford. The latter signing was an important one for the Raiders as vice-captain and star playmaker Terry Campese is out indefinitely due to a knee injury suffered in the semi-final loss to Wests at the end of the 2010 season. After starting the season with a 40-16 thumping of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in round one, the Raiders have since lost their last eight matches in succession, and were sitting at the bottom of the ladder by round nine. Their fortunes started to turn when they caused the boilover of the 2011 season, upsetting the Melbourne Storm in Melbourne by 20-12. This was Canberra's first win in the Victorian capital since 2000. This was tempered by being held scoreless for the first time at home in their history by Melbourne in round 19, losing 26-0.

The Australian tour took in 21 matches; four were test matches against the Australian national team, while the remainder were against regional and invitational teams. The British Isles lost the first test, but won the last three tests to take the series 3-1. After the first loss to the Australians, team captain Mullineux dropped himself from the team for the rest of the tour, with Frank Stout taking the captain's role for the remaining tests. The decision by Mullineux to replace his position with Charles Adamson is seen as the tour's turning point, which saw the British team begin to win matches by more convincing margins and eventually control the test games.

In 1899, the first official British team to tour Australia was selected, and Mullineux was not only chosen to captain the team, but also to manage it. Mullineux again represented the British team in the opening game, but the tourists lacked cohesion and lost to the Australians 3–13. The British Isles had under-performed in the few invitational games leading up to the first test, and after the defeat to the Wallabies, Mullineux dropped himself from the team for the remaining tests, and brought in Charlie Adamson as his replacement. The captaincy was given to Frank Stout, and the tourists play began to improve. After Mullineux's decision the British Isles played far better rugby and won the last three tests to take the series 3–1. Although no longer a part of the test team, Mullineux continued to represent the British team against the invitational and regional teams. He played in ten games on the tour, his only points came from a try in the loss against Queensland.

Before Timms would win his second Scotland cap, he was selected to represent Matthew Mullineux's British Isles team on the 1899 tour of Australia. Timms scored two tries in the opening match of the campaign, against Central Southern, but missed the next four games, including the First Test against Australia. Timms regained his place for the sixth game of the tour, and missed only two more games, becoming a regular fixture in the team. After the British lost the First Test match of the tour, and Mullineux made several changes to improve his team for the Second Test. Timms was brought in at centre as replacement for Charles Adamson, and was partnered with Gwyn Nicholls, with whom he would be paired at centre for the remaining three Tests. The British won the last three Tests, with Timms scoring a try in the Third Test at Sydney.

Ayre-Smith played club rugby for Guy's Hospital, and in 1899 he was selected to join Matthew Mullineux's British Isles team on the first official tour of Australia. Ayre-Smith played in 17 of the 20 tour matches and represented Britain in all four Test Matches against Australia. He played in the opening game of the tour, against Central Southern at Goulburn, New South Wales, before the team headed to Sydney. There he played against the New South Wales Waratahs, but missed the game against Metropolitan. Ayre-Smith was back in the team for the First Test, which the British Isles lost, 3-13. Ayre-Smith played in six of the seven invitational games between the First and Second Tests, where he was dropped from the game against Queensland, but scored his first try of the tour in the encounter with Rockhampton. Mullineux reacted to the First Test defeat, by dropping himself from the team, and moving Charlie Adamson in to his vacated half-back position for the Second Test. This was seen as the turning point of the tour and Ayre-Smith was not only part of a winning British team in the Second Test, but also scored his one and only international try during the game. Ayre-Smith played in both the final Test games, both played in Sydney and both resulting in British victories.

The greatest drama at the highest level of play in the qualifying ties, came in two Asian zone battles, both involving traditional power Malaysia. In the first of these Malaysia and Japan alternated tight victories in perhaps the longest and closest tie in Thomas Cup history. Malaysia won the last doubles match in three games to advance to the zone final, but Punch Gunalan's 17-16 third game win over Japan's Junji Honma on the second night of play shows how narrow was the difference between victory and defeat. If Malaysia had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat against Japan, however, it proceeded to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory against its next opponent, Thailand. Up three matches to none, Malaysia's undoing began when Tan Aik Huang, who had played an earlier singles, suffered a cramp and was carried off the doubles court to end the first night's play at 3–1. Though Aik Huang played the next day he lost both of his matches, and Gunalan's win at third singles was offset by Tan Aik Mong's singles loss. In the final and decisive match Gunalan and the veteran Ng Boon Bee seemed unnerved and were routed by veteran Sangob Rattanusorn and young star Bandid Jaiyen. The two Thais had also played singles and emerged as the heroes of an upset victory. Conversely, it was a sad final Thomas Cup tie for three of Malaysia's "greats," Ng Boon Bee, Tan Aik Huang, and Punch Gunalan.

In the other semifinal Thailand, an upset winner of the Asian zone qualifier, fought hard but was out-gunned by an Indonesian team that was perhaps the best yet in their then almost unbroken string of Thomas Cup success. Thailand's diminutive but highly talented Bandid Jaiyen wore down the veteran Muljadi in three games, but the Thais were unable to capture another match. Traditionally strong in doubles, the Thais dropped eight straight doubles games, only one of them close, to Indonesian pairs containing future "legends" Tjun Tjun, Christian Hadinata, and Ade Chandra. With Rudy Hartono winning all four of his matches for the fifth consecutive time, Indonesia advanced to play in its sixth straight final.

The inter-zone ties (team matches) were held in Bangkok, Thailand in late May and early June. 1973 runner-up Denmark and defending champion Indonesia received byes and awaited the winners of Malaysia versus New Zealand and Canada versus Thailand respectively. New Zealand's fate was sealed when it could not break through against the Malaysian singles lineup of Phua Ah Hua, Saw Swee Leong, and James Selvaraj, despite some competitive matches. New Zealand doubles victories, two of them after the tie had been decided, made the final score 6–3. The Purser brothers, Bryan and older brother Richard both played well in defeat for the Kiwis. The contest between Canada and host Thailand was quite lopsided. Though the Canadians had replaced several of its Pan American zone team members with younger players, it had retained the veteran ex-Thais Raphi Kanchanaraphi and Channarong Ratanaseangsuang, two heroes of Thailand's run to the Thomas Cup final a full fifteen years earlier. The old Thais could not match the young Thai doubles pairs, though, in extending one match to three games, they performed as well as anyone else on their team. Canada's singles number one Jamie McKee could average only six points a game against Thailand's Bandid Jaiyen and Surapong Suharitdamrong. Only one of the singles matches was moderately close in a 9–0 Thai victory	Canada's singles number one Jamie McKee could average only six points a game against Thailand's Bandid Jaiyen and Surapong Suharitdamrong.	/m/043l_rp	Bandid_Jaiyen	96	109	/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete
The outcome of the other semifinal was never really in doubt. Though host Thailand had received a bye into the inter-zone matches, it had also received "the short straw" by being placed in the Indonesian half of the draw. The performance of the diminutive but gifted Bandid Jaiyen, however, did offer some balm for Thailand's wounded pride. He had gained Thailand's only point against Indonesia in the previous Thomas Cup series, and did so again on the first night of play by fighting back from the brink of a straight games defeat to wear down powerhouse Iie Sumirat 15-5 in the third. Though Jaiyen played creditably on the second night against the iconic Rudy Hartono, he was beaten at 11 and 7. Surapong Suharitdamrong, the Thai number two, could collect only eleven points in four games against Hartono and Sumirat. The one close doubles match came after Indonesia had already clinched the tie to play in its seventh Thomas Cup final in seven attempts.

For the 2008-09 Asia Series season, the departing driver line-up was replaced with reigning Formula Renault 3.5 Series champion Giedo van der Garde and a series-encouraged Asian driver, Hamad Al Fardan. Van der Garde and Al Fardan scored 13 points between them, resulting in an eighth-place championship finish for the team. For the 2009 main series, Van der Garde was retained with Diego Nunes replacing Al Fardan; Van der Garde won three races but only managed seventh in the drivers' championship, whilst Nunes was back in 20th. iSport finished fifth overall in the teams' championship. Both drivers then moved on, and were replaced by Davide Valsecchi and Oliver Turvey for both the 2009-10 Asia Series and the 2010 main series. In the Asia Series, Valsecchi won three races and sealed the championship title, with rookie driver Turvey backing him up to take sixth overall, allowing iSport to win the Asia teams' championship for the first time. In the main series, however, the team was unable to maintain this level of form: Valsecchi ended the season strongly with the outfit's sole victory at Yas Marina, but was overshadowed by Turvey, who concluded the year sixth in the drivers' championship to Valsecchi's eighth. iSport maintained its fifth place in the teams' championship.

Baxter, originally from Maldon, was a Collingwood premiership player in 1910. In the Grand Final he was reported for striking by umpire Jack Elder, and suspended for the entire 1911 VFL season. Collingwood appealed the ban and it was overturned, after teammate Richard Daykin signed a declaration which stated that it was he and not Baxter who had struck Jack Baquie. As Daykin had retired after the Grand Final win, no player was suspended for the incident.

Carlton vowed never to forget this day and they soon had their revenge by winning the Premiership from Collingwood in 1915.

Herbie Matthews (20 November 1913 – 8 June 1990) was an Australian rules footballer who played for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League. He was recruited from suburban Fairfield under the League's "father and son" rule. His father, 'Butcher' Matthews, partnered the great Roy Cazaly in South Melbourne's ruck combination of the early 1920s. Although he was smaller and slighter in build than his ruckman father, he was a strong mark and showed a ferocious drive for possession of the football. He was recruited by South Melbourne at the age of 17 in the face of determined approaches from Collingwood and his local VFA club, Northcote.

In 2007, her team lost the provincial final to Hollie Nicol's rink. In 2008, her team lost in the final to Danielle Inglis. However, these losses were amended by a provincial junior championship in 2009, earning her team a berth at the 2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. At the Canadian Juniors, she skipped the Ontario team to a 10-2 record after the round robin, giving her rink a bye to the final. However, she would lose to the defending champion Kaitlyn Lawes rink from Manitoba in the final. Homan won the 2010 provincial championship and went on to represent Ontario at the 2010 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. At the 2010 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, Rachel Homan, with Emma Miskew, Laura Crocker, and Lynn Kreviazuk won the Junior National Title in dramatic fashion by completing the event with an undefeated record of 13 wins and 0 losses - only the fourth women's team to do so. The team represented Canada at the 2010 World Junior Curling Championships in Flims, Switzerland. The team dominated the tournament, losing just their final round robin game. However, the team came up short in the final, losing to Sweden.

On October 16, 1921, after the Independent battled back from a 7-0 deficit against the Chicago Cardinals to lead 14-7 in the second quarter, due to two touchdowns, scored by player-coach Frank Coughlin. Flanigan then ordered the team's tackle, Ed Healey relieve Coughlin. Once Coughlin was safely on his way toward the sideline, Healey delivered a message to Jimmy Conzelman from Flanigan, it read: "Coughlin was fired! The new coach was Conzelman!" This act marked the first and only time an owner hired a new coach in the middle of a game.

The Bloods would continue to perform poorly as they finished second last in 1980 and Trevor Hughes was sacked following the season. Club General Manager Doug Thomas and President Bob Lee enticed 1961 premiership coach Neil Kerley back to West Adelaide in 1981 and the improvement in the team was immediate. The Bloods finished 5th in 1981, defeated in the Elimination Final by Norwood. Under Kerley players such as Roger Luders, Bruce Lindner, Ian Borchard, Peter Meuret, Geoff Morris and Mark Mickan all started to play their best football and 1982 was almost a repeat of the 1981 season. Going into the final round West were locked in a battle for the 5th and final finals spot on the ladder. Unfortunately it was again Norwood who ended their run when they thumped the Bloods at Norwood Oval consigning West to a 6th place finish.

Unique for a professional football team, the All-Americans had a sharing agreement with the Union Club of Phoenixville, a side project managed by All-Americans player Heinie Miller. Miller would take himself and seven other All-Americans to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania to play games on Saturdays (Pennsylvania had blue laws that prevented play on Sunday), and then return to Buffalo on Sundays. This sharing agreement lasted into 1921 when Miller formed the new Union Quakers of Philadelphia, but All-Americans owner Frank McNeil put a halt to the agreement halfway through the 1921 season after the Quakers played the Canton Bulldogs and wore out the All-Americans players. Five All-Americans left the team to play for the Quakers full-time; Buffalo had the pickings of the then-defunct Detroit Tigers to replenish their roster.

A year later, the on-field performance went from bad to worse for the Lions as they opened the 1958 season with five straight losses. The team's on-field struggles caused Capozzi to fire Clem Crowe as the head coach and replace him with Danny Edwards, who returned after playing with the club during the 1957 season. The team was only able to manage three wins during the year, causing them to miss the playoffs once again.

Deegan was one of 25 players who made the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League clubs hailed from New York City and State, including Muriel Bevis, Gloria Cordes, Nancy Mudge, Betty Trezza and Margaret Wigiser. Born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, she was a star athlete at Abraham Lincoln High School and in 1935 was the "champion woman baseball thrower" in New York City. She learned baseball from her father, coach of the Brooklyn Bloomer Girls team. As a teenager she placed second behind Babe Didrikson Zaharias in the javelin throw in the national meet before the 1936 Summer Olympics. However, at 16 she was too young. Later, she played fastpitch softball for the New York Americanettes in 1938-39. In 1939 her batting average was .406. That year she was the guest of New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia (along with other celebrities) at the opening day of the New York World's Fair. She played later with the Manhattan Beach Girls, who competed in the Metropolitan League in Madison Square Garden. Deegan hit a 250-foot home run inside the building. Babe Ruth, the only other player ever to hit a home run inside the Garden, was in attendance, and posed for a photograph with her, squeezing her biceps. Then, she gained the nickname of "the Babe Ruth of Women's Softball".

Schroeder enjoyed her most productive season in 1954, when she posted career-highs with .304, 17 homers and 65 runs batted in. In that season, she was part of a Lassies All-Star slick infield that included June Peppas at first base, Nancy Mudge at second, and Fern Shollenberger at third. Meanwhile, the called Home Run Twins, Chris Ballingall (17) and Carol Habben (15), powered the offense with 32 home runs; Peppas enjoyed a year career, and Kalamazoo advanced to the Championship Series. As a result, the Lassies defeated the Daisies in a best-of-five games series, with a decisive eight-inning RBI double by Schroeder in Game 5, during what turned out to be the AAGPBL final season.

Gloria Cordes was one of 25 players who made the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League clubs hailed from New York City and State, including Muriel Bevis, Mildred Deegan, Nancy Mudge, Betty Trezza and Margaret Wigiser. Cordes pitched in the last five seasons of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, primarily with the Kalamazoo Lassies.

Cordes started for the Lassies in Game 2, which featured seven home runs by the two teams. Due to a mix-up over the game's starting time the umpires did not allow Cordes to warm up (supposedly there would be a half hour delay). Starting cold, she allowed five runs before getting a batter out. After a leadoff walk to Mary Weddle, Horstman belted a home run for a 2-0 Fort Wayne lead. Then Ruth Richard and Joanne Weaver hit back-to-back singles, and Betty Weaver Foss hit a three-run homer for a 5-0 edge. Elaine Roth relieved Cordes and completed the game. But the Lassies hit three more home runs, one each by Jean Geissinger and the Weaver sisters. Kalamazoo discounted the margin with leadoff shots by Nancy Mudge, Peppas (playing at first base) and Dorothy Schroeder, but the game's outcome was never in doubt.

In 1987 McCarthy was a firm fixture on both the Cork hurling and football teams. The hurlers surrendered their provincial crown to Tipperary; however, the footballers were just beginning a remarkable run of success. After a draw and a replay "the Rebel’s" broke Kerry’s stranglehold on provincial football with a 0-13 to 1-5 victory. It was McCarthy’s first Munster medal in the senior grade. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork play Meath for the first time in twenty years. Cork stormed into an early lead, however, it was Meath who led by a point at half-time.

Shea Fahy is regarded as one of the heroes of the Cork senior football team that was most successful between 1987 and 1995. Although born in County Kildare, along with team-mate Larry Tompkins, the Cork supporters and management considered him one of their own. Although he never won any honours at minor or under-21 levels Fahy won his first Munster Championship in 1987. It was the first of four Munster titles in-a-row for Fahy and Cork which also culminated in four consecutive All-Ireland final appearances. While Cork lost the first two finals to Meath they returned in 1989 and 1990 to win back-to-back titles. These resulted in Fahy winning his only two All-Ireland medals.

The Patriot League Men's Basketball Player of the Year is a basketball award given to the Patriot League's most outstanding player. The award was first given following the 1990–91 season, the first under the Patriot League name and also the league's first season as an all-sports conference. There have been four repeat-winners of the award: Adonal Foyle of Colgate (1996, 1997), Brian Ehlers of Lafayette (1999, 2000), C. J. McCollum of Lehigh (2010, 2012), and Mike Muscala of Bucknell (2011, 2013). Holy Cross and Bucknell claim the most winners with five and three other schools are tied with three winners apiece.

As a junior in 1993–94, Feaster averaged 28.0 points per game, which placed him second in the nation behind Purdue's Glenn Robinson. Despite the prolific scoring, the Crusaders only finished with a 14–14 record. He was selected to the All-Patriot League team for the third time in as many years. Feaster's final season in 1994–95 saw him earn his fourth all-conference selection behind a third consecutive season in which he led Holy Cross in scoring at 25.0 points per game. This mark also ranked him ninth nationally, and for his efforts he was named the Patriot League Player of the Year. When Feaster finished his college career, he had scored a then-Patriot League record 2,224 points (in 2012–13, his record would be broken by Lehigh's C. J. McCollum). Despite setting the conference scoring record, he still only ranks second all-time at Holy Cross. Ronnie Perry scored 2,524 points between 1976–77 and 1979–80, but at the time Holy Cross did not belong in any athletic conference and were thus classified as Independent.

Claremont failed to follow this meteoric rise, and between 1966 and 1978 participated in the finals only twice. In 1971 they were knocked out easily by an Alan Joyce-coached East Fremantle outfit, but in 1972 they lost only three home-and-away games and with players of the calibre of Graham Moss, Bruce Duperouzel, Colin Tully and Daryl Griffiths, were firm flag favourites, only to be beaten in both the second semi and grand finals by a more physical East Perth side. Despite recruiting Essendon full forward Geoff Blethyn, the Tigers fell to last in 1973 with only four wins, and did even worse in 1975 with only three wins as Moss went to Essendon. The club were involved in an unusual incident in their Round 20 clash against West Perth during the 1976 season. Claremont coach Mal Brown replaced John Colreavy with Ross Ditchburn at three-quarter time, but when another player went off injured in the last quarter, Brown sent Colreavy back onto the ground, in contravention of the rule which specified that a player being replaced could not return to the field. Claremont lost the game 20.21 (141) to 13.18 (96), but had their score annulled after the game. When Moss returned in 1977 as captain-coach, he gradually moulded one of the most individually talented teams in WAFL history with such players as Jim and Phil Krakouer, Ken Hunter, Wayne Blackwell, John Annear, and Warren Ralph. In 1981 they kicked an Australian record 3,352 points in 21 matches, and won their fifth flag over an inaccurate South Fremantle. Despite lacking the “enforcer” needed to win many flags under pressure, between 1979 and 1994 Claremont played in the finals every year bar 1985 and 1992, and under Gerard Neesham’s extremely innovative coaching methods and “chip and draw” style, they won twenty and drew one of their last 21 games in 1987. Neesham’s skill was such that Claremont reached five successive grand finals for three flags despite the loss of most key players to the VFL (later AFL).

After three decades among the WAFL elite, Perth declined abruptly in 1979, winning only eight games of twenty-one and finishing a distant sixth. The departure of Armstrong to Subiaco in 1980 only made things worse: between 1980 and 1985 Perth never improved upon 1979’s sixth place and won only 28 of its 126 games. The recruitment of proven coach Mal Brown that year was hoped to return the Demons to a WAFL power, but after finishing third in 1986 the club was devastated by the loss of players to new VFL club West Coast and fell back down the ladder, ultimately taking wooden spoons in 1993 and 1994 and not being able to stay far from the bottom.

As a football player, "Jacko" was a full forward of great potential. He started his senior career in the West Australian Football League with South Fremantle in 1979. Mal Brown, who was coaching South Fremantle at the time, employed Jackson as a tough forward to protect Ray Bauskis, a skillful but lightweight full-forward. It worked well, with Jackson kicking 53 goals from 22 games and Bauskis 66 from 17 games. South Fremantle finished 2nd that year, but the night before the second semi-final, Jackson returned to Melbourne, after being told that the other players had voted him out of the team.

Neil Elvis Winmar was born in Kellerberrin, Western Australia, to Neil and Meryle Winmar. He grew up in the neighbouring Wheatbelt town of Pingelly. and played for the Brookton/Pingelly Football Club in the Upper Great Southern Football League (UGSFL) from an early age. Winmar was subsequently recruited by South Fremantle in the Perth-based WAFL after the club's coach at the time, Mal Brown, saw Winmar playing for Brookton/Pingelly. He made his senior debut for South Fremantle in round nine of the 1983 season, aged 17, and played a total of 13 games in his debut season. In the beginning, he was used across the wings and half-forward flanks, but was later played as a rover, although he remained a regular goal-kicker. In total, Winmar played 58 games for South Fremantle between 1983 and 1986, kicking 98 goals.

In the 1967 season, Denny Vietch became the new General Manager of the club. Denny Veitch's first move was to fire Skrien after the Lions lost their first three games of the season. Veitch named Jim Champion as head coach, but the Lions would end up finishing the season with a 3–12–1 record. The only two positives for the club were two rookies; wide receiver Jim Young and kicker Ted Gerela, who would end up winning the Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy as the Western Conference's Rookie of the Year.

The 2009–10 offseason saw the club lose even more veterans, many who were cut by Buono, and others who left for the NFL. Quarterback Buck Pierce was released on March 9, 2010 after the return of Casey Printers meant that the injury-prone Pierce was expendable. The Lions also released former Special Teams Player of the Year Ian Smart, linebacker Javier Glatt and defensive back Lavar Glover, each of whom played a major role in the Lions' 2006 Grey Cup win. The team also lost Rolly Lumbala and Ryan Grice-Mullen to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, while rookie phenom Martell Mallett signed with the Philadelphia Eagles.

His first WRC event was the 1987 Swedish Rally behind the wheel of his Nova, and again two years later, driving the Sierra and finishing 15th overall. Later that year, he finished 5th overall at Rally New Zealand in a rear wheel drive Sierra Cosworth. By 1990 McRae was driving a Sierra Cosworth 4x4 and achieved sixth place in that year's RAC Rally, despite several accidents. 1991 saw McRae turn professional as he was signed by Prodrive boss David Richards to his Subaru team in the British Rally Championship for an annual wage of approximately £10,000. McRae was British Rally Champion in both 1991 and 1992, soon graduating to the Subaru factory team at World Rally Championship level. 1992 also saw Colin McRae make his début in the British Touring Car Championship, with a one-off appearance for the Prodrive-run BMW factory team at the Knockhill round. In the second of the two races of the event, McRae collided with Matt Neal. Race officials found McRae to have caused an avoidable collision and subsequently disqualified him.

The Xedos 6 was used in the BTCC in 1993 and 1994. Patrick Watts was given the Xedos 6 for the 1993 season after the 323F proved unsuccessful in 1992. The Xedos 6 proved to be a much better package in 1993 with Patrick Watts taking a pole position at Snetterton and 3 4th positions. He finished 15th in the championship which was not excellent and lost support from Mazda which extended to a 2 car team known as Team Mazda in 1994. David Leslie and Matt Neal drove for the team in 1994 but both failed to finish the season after Matt Neal was badly shaken after a big rollover at Silverstone and David Leslie after Mazda pulled out during the season.

The 1953 Five Nations Championship saw another good Welsh run, losing only to eventual champions England. Jones was again picked for all four games, but only managed a single try against Scotland. 1953 also saw the arrival in Wales of the touring New Zealand team. On 19 December, Wales and the All Blacks met at the Cardiff Arms Park with the New Zealand team so far unbeaten in the tour. Welsh hopes were raised after two New Zealand draws against Swansea and Ulster, and Wales were favourites to win the contest. The game did not start as was expected, and Wales were chasing the game after New Zealand took an early lead. In the last twenty minutes Wales appeared to raise their game and started playing offensive rugby. Gareth Griffiths returned to the field despite dislocating his shoulder and Clem Thomas moved back into the pack and the Welsh play became more focused. Gwyn Rowlands kicked a penalty to bring the scores level and with five minutes to go Clem Thomas made a dash down the left hand touchline. With his path cut off by the All Black defense, Thomas cross-kicked the ball for Jones to take it on the bounce. Jones rounded Ron Jarden on the inside and scored his most memorable and final try of his Welsh career. With Rowlands converting the score Wales had beaten New Zealand 13-8.

As was usual for touring teams visiting East Africa during the 1950s, 1960's and 1970s, the Lions were given private hospitality as opposed to staying in hotels. Cliff Morgan, Haydn Morris and Gareth Griffiths (all players with Cardiff RFC) stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Arthur "Pat" Bryant, who had played for Cardiff prior to World War I, and who was an official of the East African Rugby Union. He had refereed for the RFUEA (in his blue and black Cardiff jersey) until his retirement at about 63 years of age. The tourists also encountered another former Cardiff player from the 1940s, Captain Howell Loveluck who was in Kenya as chaplain to the British Forces stationed there at the time of the Mau Mau Uprising.

On lap 13, with Toccacelo attempting a move up the inside of Lebanon driver Beschir, the pair's wheels touched, sending Beschir into a frightening barrel-roll across the gravel trap, and causing the introduction of the safety car, to slow the cars around the track whilst the debris was cleared. This gave the top three a good opportunity to pit, but Brazil had big troubles with a wheel, allowing Great Britain to jump into the lead, ahead of Australia, and leaving Piquet in third. Under the safety car, however, the British car suffered another battery failure, and forcing Kerr to retire and hand the lead to Will Power. Power made the most of the restart, opening up a good lead over Brazil, with A1 Team Mexico in third place. Only a few laps later though, A1 Team Russia driver Alexey Vasilyev spun off the track and forced the safety car to come out again. This time when the race restarted, Piquet was much closer to the back of Power, and took the lead on lap 29. With 32 laps completed, Brazil had opened up a good lead, setting the all-important fastest race lap in the process. Australia sat in 2nd position, in front of Salvador Durán for Mexico, who was being pressured by Halliday. Malaysia held an impressive 5th place, followed by South Africa and the Netherlands.

In 2002, Kerry were still the masters of provincial football and Ó Sé guided his county to a sixth Munster title. Kerry later reached a third All-Ireland final under Ó Sé, this time with Armagh providing the opposition. At half-time it looked as if Kerry were on course for the ultimate victory. The Ulstermen lost John McEntee to concussion while Oisín McConville missed a penalty just before the interval. With a four-point lead and playing into the wind Kerry were set. McConville, however, scored a decisive goal in the fifty-fifth minute which stunned Kerry. Ó Sé's side failed to score for the last seventeen minutes as Armagh went on to claim their first All-Ireland title with a 1-12 to 0-14 victory.

In 2002 Kerry crashed out of the provincial championship at an early stage. In spite of this Ó Cinnéide’s side still had a chance of winning the All-Ireland title via the scenic route in the All-Ireland qualifiers. After successfully negotiating through the early stages Kerry trounced Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final before stuffing archrivals Cork in a unique all-Munster All-Ireland semi-final. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kerry against Armagh in one of the great finals of recent years. The first-half saw everything going Kerry’s way while Armagh floundered. The Ulster men lost John McEntee to concussion while Oisín McConville missed a penalty just before the interval. As it stood Armagh trailed by four points at half-time and Ó Cinnéide’s side looked to be in the driving seat. A different Armagh team emerged in the second-half. McConville compensated for his earlier miss by scoring a key goal in the 55th minute. Kerry froze after this and failed to score for the rest of the match as Armagh went on to narrowly win their first All-Ireland by 1-12 to 0-14.

In 2002 Kerry faced more controversy. The team were forced to play a replay of their Munster semi-final against Cork only a few of days after the funeral of the brother of team manager Páidí Ó Sé and father of team members Darragh, Tomás and Marc Ó Sé. Cork took full advantage and Kerry embarked on a qualifier campaign which saw them account for Wicklow, Fermanagh and Kildare before they trounced reigning champions Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final before stuffing archrivals Cork in a unique all-Munster All-Ireland semi-final.

Watkins made his international debut for Wales against Scotland on 1 February 1964. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, it was Scotland's only defeat of the season and would be the key game in Wales winning the championship that year. Watkins would represent his country on 26 occasions, and his most notable game came against France on 26 March 1966. It was the final game of the tournament and Wales were trailing by 8 points to a team they had beaten only once in the last eight encounters. Keith Bradshaw had dragged Wales back into the game with two penalty goals when Watkins intercepted a French three quarter movement on his own 25 yard line. He raced 75 yards down the right touch line to score a memorable try that not only gave Wales the match but also the championship.

Van Asseldonk graduated into single-seaters at the start of the 2010 season, moving into Formula BMW. He made his début at the level in the Pacific series with Motaworld Racing, taking part in the season-opening round at Sepang as a guest driver. This was a precursor to his main campaign in the pan-European championship later in the year, competing for the Josef Kaufmann Racing team alongside Robin Frijns and Petri Suvanto. Van Asseldonk had a tough first half of the season, taking only one top-five finish in four meetings; a fifth place finish at Zandvoort during the Masters of Formula 3-support event. The first of two late-season podiums came at Hockenheim for van Asseldonk, as he finished in third place behind Frijns and Jack Harvey; the first time that two Dutch drivers had featured on the podium, while it was van Asseldonk's first victory in the Rookie Cup for first-season drivers. He took another third place at the final meeting of the year – and, ultimately the series – at Monza, with Frijns winning the race again ahead of Côme Ledogar. He ultimately finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship, and second to Carlos Sainz, Jr. in the Rookie Cup.

Apart from supporting the individual host cities' requests, the IRB did not focus its own efforts on returning the sport to the Olympics until the early 1990s, when efforts began to reunite the two movements with a series of informal meetings between the then IRB Secretary, Keith Rowlands, and the British Olympic Association Secretary, Dick Palmer. In 1994, when Vernon Pugh QC of Wales was elected Chairman of the IRB, the march towards Olympic recognition began in earnest. Pugh convinced the IRB Council that Olympic membership – initially as a non-participation sport – would be beneficial to rugby and offer the IRB member unions membership of their National Olympic Committees. Many European Federations, such as France, Italy and Romania, had been members of their National Olympic Committees for decades. The demand to get rugby back in the Olympics mounted as more rugby nations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas joined the IRB, because it was a sport seen as providing a realistic medal opportunity for a number of smaller nations.

Tyrone exited the 2006 Football Championship after a poor display against Laois, on a wet Saturday night in O'Moore Park, Portlaoise. and followed this up with a poor showing in the 2007 National Football League. However the team bounced back by winning the 2007 Ulster Senior Football Championship at Clones in July for the first time since 2003 but then fell to Meath in the All-Ireland Quarter Final. The Tyrone panel had been depleted by injury, with team captain Brian Dooher (shattered kneecap), inspirational play maker Brian McGuigan (damaged eye) and midfielder Colin Holmes ruled out for the season, while other key players, including Stephen O'Neill, Gerard Cavlan, Michael McGee and Conor Gormley, all missing most or all of the 2007 campaign due to injury. The 2008 campaign has once again plagued by injuries although things appear to looking up for the red hands after a rather disappointing league campaign finishing with a mid table position. Things then got worse for Tyrone as they relinquished their Ulster title to Down after a two game thriller in which Down edged them by a point after 160 minutes of football. After two wins in the Football Qualifiers against Louth at Drogheda and Westmeath at Healy Park in Omagh respectively, they faced Mayo in Round 3 on Saturday 2 August in Croke Park for a place in the quarter finals of the Championship. Tyrone went on to defeat Mayo on a scoreline of 0-13 to 1-9 meaning Tyrone earned a place in the quarter finals (last 8) of the championship, where they faced Leinster champions Dublin. Tyrone made the brighter start to this game with early points from Tommy McGugian and Colm McCullagh, Dublin got back to level terms however Tyrone pulled away with 2 further points the pick from captain Brian Dooher and a goal from Sean Cavanagh gave them a commanding 1-5 to 0-2 lead, a mix up in the Tyrone full back line lead to a soft Connall Keaney goal however Dublin's celebrations were short lived an a beautiful angled ball from Tommy McGuigan gave Joe McMahon a goal opportunity which he took in style to put Tyrone 2-5 to 1-2 up, Dublin scored another point before half-time to leave them trailing by 5 at the break. On the restart Tyrone added 2 points with McCullagh and Dooher the scorers. A brief Dublin revival followed with back to back points, But Tyrone raced up the field with Colin Holmes giving the ball McCullagh who the picked out the running half back David Harte and he made no mistake with the finish giving Tyrone a 3rd goal an ending the game as a contest. Harte, Cavanagh and Dooher added points but Dublin looked like a beat team with 20 minutes to go. While no Tyrone player had a bad game the GAA man of the match award went to Brian Dooher who scored 3 points and also set up vital plays bringing the ball out of defense. Tyrone then faced Wexford for a place in the senior football final but earlier in the day it was the Tyrone minors who booked their place in the final with a complete football performance, and eased past Meath on a scoreline of 1-21 to 2-7. They face Mayo in the final. The seniors then always looked comfortable in their meeting with Wexford. And after racking up a 8 point lead at half-time they went through pretty comfortably with 6 points to spare, However Wexford did cause problems during 10 minutes of the second half to bring the gap down to two points, then scores from Phillip Jordan, Colm McCullagh and Ryan McMenamin made sure that Tyrone would set up a September 21 date with All Ireland champions Kerry (who beat Cork earlier in the day 3-14 to 2-13). Tyrone's Colm McCullagh was named the GAA Man of the match after setting up and indeed taking crucial scores at the right times. Since then, Tyrone have gone downhill a lot, and were defeated in Killarney by Kerry in the 2012 All Ireland Championship.	The Tyrone panel had been depleted by injury, with team captain Brian Dooher (shattered kneecap), inspirational play maker Brian McGuigan (damaged eye) and midfielder Colin Holmes ruled out for the season, while other key players, including Stephen O'Neill, Gerard Cavlan, Michael McGee and Conor Gormley, all missing most or all of the 2007 campaign due to injury.	/m/026n7pq	Michael_McGee	273	286	/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete

Subsequently, Davos became a famous ski resort, especially frequented by tourists from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

2005–06 (Guinness Premiership)
Many pundits had tipped Bristol as relegation certainties in 2005–06, but they defied the critics with some strong performances. A surprise home victory to local rivals Bath was followed by a win away at Newcastle but these September wins were followed by a fallow period in the Guinness Premiership until the visits from Leeds Tykes and Sale Sharks in November. Leicester Tigers were also surprise losers at the Memorial Ground in December, and Bristol morale got a lift when they secured a draw against high-flying London Wasps in February. The season was capped by away victories over Saracens and Gloucester and a decisive home win against Newcastle Falcons in April. Some individual players stood out: winger David Lemi surprised many defences with his speed and agility, Brian Lima proved tough to beat at centre, fly-half Jason Strange had an impressive goal-kicking record and scrum-half Shaun Perry had been called up to captain England Saxons by the season's end on the strength of play at Bristol. Among the forwards Mark Regan and Dan Ward-Smith imposed themselves on the opposition, while flanker Matt Salter was arguably the side's most important player and was awarded the Guinness Premiership's 'Captain of the Year' by Sky Sports at an end of year awards ceremony.

O'Neill's return to action came earlier than many expected during the 2008 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, as a 25th minute sub for the injured Colm McCullagh. Although he failed to register a score he caused the Kerry defence a number of problems and helped Tyrone to their third Senior Football Championship win in six years. Despite being entitled to one, O'Neill refused to accept his winner's medal, saying that he "did not earn" it. He was visibly upset as he was climbing the steps to be presented the trophy, and had to be consoled by teammates, such as Conor Gormley.

He played hurling as a full-back with the Limerick Senior Hurling team, with whom he won a National Hurling League medal in 1947, and also with his local club Ahane. He retired prematurely from the game following a serious head injury sustained in a club match in 1949. His brothers Seán Herbert and Tony Herbert were also hurlers with Limerick and his son Turlough Herbert was a member of the Limerick senior hurling panel for the 1994 All-Ireland final.

Football in Galway was set back by the defeat of the 1983 team by the depleted Dublin team, down to 12 men after three were sent off. Galway struggled. That team had led the eventual All Ireland champions Offaly for most of the 1982 All Ireland semi-final, succumbing to a point from goalscorer Brendan Lowry. Depleted by four injuries and a fifth to free-taker Gay MacManus, Galway were well beaten in 1984, but near-misses in semi-finals against Tyrone in 1986 and Cork in 1987 (when Larry Tompkins forced a replay) left the county out of the reckoning until another three-point defeat at the hands of Tyrone in 1995. However, that return to the semi final stage after an eight year break was to be the catalyst for further breakthroughs. Led by Mayo-born manager John O'Mahoney, and with outstanding performances from Ja Fallon and Michael Donnellan and a superbly taken goal from Padraig Joyce, Galway succeeded in 1998 and came back for an astonishing demolition of Meath in 2001 after losing the 2000 final in a replay to Kerry. In 2005, Galway won the Connacht Finals by beating Mayo 0–10 to 0–8. They then lost to qualifiers, Cork 2–14 to 2–11 in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals. In 2008, they again won the Connacht finals over Mayo 2–12 to 1–14. Then Galway fell to the eventual All-Ireland Runners-Up, Kerry, by a score of 1–21 to 1–16. In 2009, Galway opened the Championship in London where they won 1–18 to 1–7. In the semi-final, Galway took on Sligo. With a tied match in injury time, Joe Bergin added his only point of the match followed by a Sean Armstrong goal. Galway was off to their 5th straight Connacht Final where they would face Mayo. Mayo was coming off a blow-out of Roscommon (3–18 to 0–7). Mayo was walking through the Final leading 2–11 to 0–10 with little time left. Galway then began a comeback that started with a Micheal Meehan free. Meehan nearly scored a goal but Kenneth O'Malley of Mayo batted the ball over the bar. In the 72nd minute, Galway trailed by 3 points when Michael Meehan got a high kick pass and struck the net to tie the match. But, Peadar Gardiner of Mayo put over the winning point in the 73rd minute ending Galway's comeback(2–12 to 1–14). Galway was sent off to the final round of the qualifiers where they lost to Donegal 0–14 to 0–13 ending their 2009 campaign that started very promising. After the resignation of Liam Sammon former Armagh manager Joe Kernan stepped in as the new Galway GAA Manager. The Galway Senior Footballers' had a disappointing 2010. From a National League campaign that was close to relegation to losing to Wexford by a single point in the 2nd round of the qualifiers. Galway won 3 and lost 4 of their 7 National League games. They defeated Monaghan 1-20 to 1-14, Tyrone 1-15 to 0-14 and Dublin 1-14 to 0-14. They lost to Mayo 1-10 to 2-14, Cork 1-17 to 1-19, Kerry 1-9 to 2-16 and Derry 1-12 to 2-13. They had a disastrous start to the Connacht Championship, just scraping past New York 2-13 to 0-12. The Connacht Semi final against Sligo showed very little improvement. At halftime, Galway trailed Sligo 1-8 to 0-2. However, Galway managed to grab an undeserved draw against Sligo, an Eoin Concannon goal and a Gareth Bradshaw point levelled the match at 1-10 each at full-time. Sligo beat Galway in the replay, 1-14 to 0-16. As a result, Galway went into the qualifiers. They faced Wexford in the 2nd round in Pearse Stadium, a week after the Sligo defeat. They suffered their second consecutive one point defeat in the 2010 Championship, 1-11 to 0-13, against Wexford and in the process were dumped out of the Championship.Kernan resigned as Galway Senior Football manager on 4 August 2010, after only one year in charge. He felt his position as manager was being 'undermined'. In October 2010 former Westmeath boss Tomás Ó Flatharta was appointed as the new Galway Manager to replace Joe Kernan. In 2011 Galway became the first county to display the name of a charity on their county jersey rather than a corporate sponsor. In 2011 proved to be a disappointing League for The Galway Senior Footballers' as they were unfortunate to be relegated to Division 2 despite making improvements against Cork, Armagh & Dublin. The Connacht championship started very poorly despite Galway taken the lead in the first half but were beaten by rivals Mayo,1-12 to 1-6 which sent Galway to the qualifiers.Galway suffered their 2nd championship defeat to Meath 0-11 to 0-10.As a result Tomás Ó Flatharta was axed as manager only after spending one year in charge.In October 2011 Alan Mulholland former U21 manager was appointed as Senior manager as replacement after success in charge of the U21's. The 2012 season saw a vast improvement for The Galway Senior Footballers' from the FBD League right through to The League Quarter final which saw wins over Derry, Meath, Monaghan & two defeats by Westmeath & Tyrone & two draws from Louth & Kildare after extra-time. They had an impressive start to the Connacht Championship trouncing Roscommon 3-15 to 0-10. The Connacht Semi Final against proved to be quite a tense during the first half only for Sligo to run out winners on a margin 2-15 to 0-16 thanks to two goals from Adrain Marren. For the 2011 and 2012 season the maroon jersey of Galway will carry the emblem of the charity Cancer Care West. Christy Cooney, President of the GAA officially launched the announcement and said, "Congratulations to the Galway GAA Football Board and Cancer Care West on the Partnership put in place, which shows in a very strong way, the whole community ethos that exists between the GAA to support worthy and worthwhile projects such as this." Galway were knocked out of the 2012 championship by Antrim which has raised many questions around the structures within football in the county and how far the county has fallen back in the last 10 years. In 2013 saw The tribesmen having a mixed league campaign missing out promotion to Division 1 for the 2nd season in a row. They had a dreadful start to The Connacht Championship getting humiliated by neighbours Mayo on a scoreline of 4-16 to 0-11 and ending the game with 13 players sending the Tribesmen on route to the quailifiers .

In 1974 former All-Ireland winning captain Kevin Heffernan took over as manager of Dublin in time for the championship. Keaveney's retirement was short-lived as the new manager persuaded him to return to the team. The St. Vincent's man agreed and was immediately vindicated when Dublin reached the Leinster final of 1974. Archrivals Meath set out to stop 'the Dubs' claiming a first provincial title since 1965. The new look Dublin made no mistake in securing a 1-14 to 1-9 victory. It was Keaveney's second Leinster winners' medal. Dublin later surprisingly defeated All-Ireland title-holders Cork in the semi-final, thus booking a place in the All-Ireland final against Galway. The men fom the west, who had been beaten in two of the previous three championship deciders, took a 1-4 to 0-5 lead at half-time, however, the real turning point of the game came in the 52nd minute. Galway were awarded a penalty which Liam Sammon stepped up to take. Goalkeeper Paddy Cullen made no mistake and saved the shot. 'The Dub's' later went on to take the lead as Galway collapsed. A 0-14 to 1-6 score line resulted in a first All-Ireland winners' medal for Kevaeney and a first for Dublin in eleven years.

Immediately after retiring from inter-county activity Hogan became involved in coaching. He was a selector on the Tipperary senior team under Fr Tom Fogarty and Nicky English in the 1990s before later taking charge of the J.K. Bracken's club. Hogan served as manager of his native county's senior team between 2003 and 2005, but his term in charge was largely unsuccessful.

Eddie Keher of the Rower-Inistioge holds numerous championship scoring records. In 50 championship appearances between 1959 and 1977 he scored 35 goals and 334 points. Not only that but Keher also set and broke a number of individual records. In the 1963 All-Ireland final he scored 14 points, a verifiable record for a final up to that point. In 1971 Keher broke his own record when he captured 2 goals and 11 points in the All-Ireland final against Tipperary. What is more remarkable is the fact that he ended up on the losing side on that occasion. This record was broken by Nicky English in 1989 when he scored 2 goals and 12 points in a 70-minute All-Ireland final. Keher's tally of 6 goals and 45 points in the 1972 championship is also a record.

Selected as the Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1972, Keher subsequently succeeded Christy Ring as the all-time top championship scorer. His tally of 36 goals and 307 points was a record which stood for over thirty years until it was surpassed by his fellow county man Henry Shefflin. His tally of 2 goals and 11 points in the All-Ireland final of 1972 was a record score for a final which stood until Nicky English surpassed it by a single point in 1989.

In 1988 Galway reached a fourth successive All-Ireland final. After more than a decade-and-a-half in the wilderness Tipperary, the fallen superpower, were back providing the opposition in the championship decider. Galway defeated Tipp in the semi-final the previous year, however, with an extra year’s experience it was expected that Tipperary might shade the victory. Galway, however, used this to motivate themselves as they believed their championship victory the previous year did not earn them the respect they were due. Noel Lane again scored the crucial goal for Galway while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1-15 to 0-14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and a third All-Ireland title, ensuring that the eighties definitely belonged to Galway.

Despite a late return to county football in the 2006 National Football League he finished the league as the second highest scorer with a score of 2-12 (0-6f). In his opening game in the Championship for Dublin in the Leinster Senior Football Championship quarter final, he is regarded as single handedly winning the game for Dublin. In what proved to be a poor Dublin performance, Keaney scored a 0-8 (0-6f) against Longford in a game that sent Dublin into the Leinster Senior Football Championship Semi-Final against Laois in Croke Park. His form continued against Laois as Keaney added another 0-06 (2f), as Dublin strolled into the Leinster final. Conal Keaney (for football) and Cork hurling star John Gardiner were named as the Vodafone Players of the Month for June 2006. Keaney won a Leinster senior football medal with Dublin in their victory in the final in 2006. At club level, Keaney made it to the fourth round of the Dublin Senior Football Championship with Ballyboden St Endas, losing to southside rivals Kilmacud Crokes. In October 2006 Conal was called up to represent Leinster in the Railway Cup. Keaney scored 1-03 against Ulster in the Railway Cup semi-final, sending Leinster to the final for a second year in a row. He has been nominated for an all-star for his 2006 performances in the half forward line. Keaney was on the winning team for Leinster in the Martin Donnelly Cup final against Connacht scoring (0-4, 3 frees).

He was born in Helmsley, Yorkshire, England in 1807 and came to Niagara in Upper Canada in 1835 where he entered business as a bookseller. With George Menzies as a partner, he began publishing the Niagara Chronicle in 1837.

He took on other business interests and also served as customs collector at Niagara. Simpson served on the council for Niagara District and the town council for Niagara, serving as mayor from 1852 to 1855. In 1857, he was elected to the Legislative Council for Niagara; he was reelected in 1861 and 1863. In March 1864, he was named to the Executive Council as provincial secretary.

Venezuela competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki, Finland. 38 competitors, 36 men and 2 women, were selected by the Comité Olímpico Venezolano to take part in 37 events in 8 sports. For the first time, women took part in a Venezuelan representation in the Summer Olympics. These were the fencers Gerda Muller and Ursula Selle, both competing in individual foil. Women's were absent of Venezuelan representations in four occasions including next summer games held in Melbourne. The 1952 Games were considered a great step forward in sports in Venezuela since previous Venezuelan delegation was of only one athlete. Arnoldo Devonish won the nation's first ever Olympic medal and to date only Olympic Medallist in Athletics.

Two of Dunphy’s nephews later lined out for their native-county of Kilkenny. Dick Dunphy was the goalkeeping understudy to the legendary Ollie Walsh throughout the 1960s while Joe Dunphy Jnr. captained Kilkenny to back-to-back All-Ireland titles at minor level in 1961 and 1962 before later lining out at senior level.

Not long after the restart Cork leveled the scores courtesy of a Gerald McCarthy point and a pointed free from Seánie Barry. Kilkenny’s sharpshooter Eddie Keher put his team a point ahead shortly after as he converted yet another free. For the second time in the game Cork took the upper hand against the run of play when Colm Sheehan captured his second goal of the game. In spite of all Kilkenny’s dominance in the first-half Cork were now in the lead by 2-4 to 0-8. Seánie Barry stretched Cork’s lead to three points in the forty-second minute of play before Eddie Keher scored his seventh point of the day to reduce the deficit to two points. Joe Dunphy narrowed the gap to the bare minimum with another point as the game turned into a tense affair once again. Just as Kilkenny were clawing their way back Cork got another run of luck against the run of play. A John O'Halloran shot hit off the crossbar and landed into the Kilkenny net to give Cork a third goal and a 3-5 to 0-10 lead.

The tradition on earlier Australian tours had been that the manager took care of arrangements and the Asst-Manager fulfilled the coaching duties. Shehadie reports that Arnold Tancred and McLean coached and trained the 1947–48 side with vigour while Jeff Noseda took care of tour administration. Journalist Phil Tressider accompanied the touring party and wrote of Tancred "I remember Tancred as a grim, brooding man who not only managed the team but coached it and was sole selector. He would brook no interference and he kept the press at arm's length. He was fortified by his experiences as a player with the 1927-28 Waratahs and he had an aching ambition for victory", Shehadie wrote of Tancred. " was a very strict disciplinarian who was determined that we would win as many matches as possible. He would constantly remind us that we would only be remembered for the number of matches we won"  and goes on to quote Jack Pollard: "The only criticism of Tancred was that relied perhaps too heavily on the team's proven stars and did not give newcomers many opportunities. He barred sportswriters travelling with the team from staying in the same hotel, was uncooperative with the Press, and the team did not enjoy very sympathetic media coverage".

Upon his return to Sydney in the 1920s he was active as a player at the Glebe-Balmain club. He made representative appearances for the New South Wales state side. In 1923 the New Zealand Māori rugby union team visited and Tancred appeared in two games of the three match series in which the Waratahs were undefeated. With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of their 1920s fixtures, including Tancred's two appearances in Sydney in June 1923, were decreed in 1986 as official Test matches. Tancred thus claimed a total of two international rugby caps for Australia. His brothers Arnold and Jim were also Australian national rugby representatives both making the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada. Harry would later be involved in the administration of both the Randwick and Drummoyne Rugby Clubs.

Howell also notes that Hardcastle had a lifelong debilitating stutter. This affected his ability to communicate quickly on-field but also led to an amusing incident on the 1947-48 tour when Hardcastle was nominated after the Swansea match to give the traditional visitor's response to the after-dinner speech. When tour manager Arnold Tancred called upon "the esteemed Dr Phil Hardcastle" to reply, Hardcastle got to his feet and said "Gee-gee-gee-gentlemen, w-w-words f-f-fail me" and sat down.

The Blues began as the Waterbury Blues and were owned by George Mulligan, the leading sports promoter in Connecticut during the 1920s. He hired local men, both former college players and walk-ons, at a per game wage. The players practiced once a week, on Sunday morning, just before each game. In 1925 Mulligan set his sights on signing Harry Stuhldreher, the quarterback of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame. He immediately accepted Mulligan's offer to play for the Blues for $7,500, plus a $500 bonus. Waterbury's other top backs at the start of the 1925 season were Ken Simendinger, from Holy Cross, and Dutch Forst, from Villanova. The line featured two other Notre Dame alumni. Ed Hunsinger played with the Four Horsemen in 1924 and rejoined Stuhldreher as an end in Waterbury. Art Garvey, a brawny tackle, had played pro ball for several years since leaving Notre Dame in 1922. He had received some All-League mention as a Chicago Bear in 1923. Another lineman, Dick McGrath, doubled as captain and coach.

From 1901 through 1904, Michigan didn't lose a single game. The streak was finally halted at the end of the 1905 season by Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons, a team that went go on to win two Big 9 (as the Western Conference was now being called with the addition of Iowa and Indiana) titles in the next three years. The game, dubbed "The First Greatest Game of the Century," broke Michigan's 56-game unbeaten streak and marked the end of the "Point-a-Minute" years. The 1905 Michigan team had outscored opponents 495–0 in its first 12 games. The game was lost in the final ten minutes of play when Denny Clark was tackled for a safety as he attempted to return a punt from behind the goal line. Michigan tied for another Big 9 title in 1906 before opting to go independent for the 1907 season.

The game was a punting duel between Eckersall and Michigan's John Garrels and was scoreless until early in the third quarter when a Michigan punt and Chicago penalty pinned Chicago inside their own ten-yard line. On third down, as Eckersall attempted to punt, he encountered a fearsome rush, but evaded the Michigan tacklers and was able to scramble to the 22-yard line and a first down. After three more first downs, the drive stalled and Chicago was forced to punt again. Eckersall's booming punt carried into the end zone where it was caught by Michigan's William Dennison Clark who attempted to run the ball out. He advanced the ball forward to the one-yard line, but was hit hard by Art Badenoch and then was brought back inside his own end zone by Mark Catlin for a two-point safety. Under the rules of the time, forward progress was not credited, and a ball carrier could be carried backwards or forwards until he was down. The rest of third and fourth quarters continued as a defensive stalemate. Chicago's 2–0 victory snapped Michigan's 56-game unbeaten streak and gave Chicago the national championship for 1905.

Born in Collingwood, Victoria, Richards' passion for Collingwood grew out of family connections – he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather Charlie H. Pannam (shortened from Pannamopoulos after migrating to Australia from Greece), and uncles Charles and Alby Pannam, both former Magpie players. His brother Ron Richards also played for the club. The Richards/Pannam dynasty made Collingwood the only club to have been captained by three generations of the one family. As a family they played over 1200 games between them.

Despite a strong Brier appearance and season, Gushue said that the team seemed to lack a needed chemistry and that Korab's departure was a group decision.

Established in 1987, Steelstown GAC is one of the youngest clubs in the county. The founding members were mostly people from rural areas of the county who had moved to the city. They included twice All Star Anthony McGurk from Lavey, his wife Mary, Philip and Marion Devlin from Drumsurn and Mickey Doherty from Claudy. The first team was an U-12 team and they were actually called Steelstown/Pennyburn, because they drew players from the two schools, and played at Templemore Sports Complex. The club gained access to the North Derry Board in 1996 and a Senior team was formed for the first time. With the recent explosion of popularity of Gaelic games in Derry City, the club has gained a lot of members since the mid-1990s and Steelstown is probably making the best upwards strides of any club in the city.

The perception of Henrich's weight being too high was fueled further by the culture of elite gymnastics, which was dominated by "pixies"—small, underweight, prepubescent girls. Henrich's own coach, Al Fong—coach of the late Julissa Gomez, who also reportedly felt pushed into doing something unsafe for her health when she kept attempting the difficult-to-master Yurchenko vault until she was rendered quadriplegic in a vaulting accident—had also allegedly made insulting remarks about her size and body type. Desperate to move up the ranks in the highly competitive world of Olympic-level gymnastics, Henrich took the criticisms to heart; her drive to lose a few pounds progressed to unhealthy eating habits and, eventually, became full-blown anorexia nervosa.

The Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to a one-year contract for 2002 as a backup, but he did not play. The move to initially sign Batch was not a surprise, given that Batch was from Pittsburgh and the Steelers' current Director of Football Operations Kevin Colbert initially drafted Batch in Detroit. Despite not playing in 2002 (being third string behind Kordell Stewart and Tommy Maddox, who split the year as the starters), Batch became popular with Steeler fans, likely due to having grown up in nearby Homestead.

Septimus Brutton (26 July 1869 – 29 September 1933) was an English cricketer. Brutton was a right-handed batsman. He was born at Tynemouth, Northumberland. The son of Thomas Brutton, the Vicar and Rural Dean of Tynemouth, and Saran Ann, Brutton was one of nine children. A notable sibling was his brother Ernest, who himself would play first-class cricket and play international rugby for England.

In 1953, Horstman hit .292 with 46 runs batted in and 23 extrabases in 94 games, including 46 runs and a career-high 14 stolen bases. She also went 11–5 with 57 strikeouts and a 2.32 ERA in 17 games, being selected for the All-Star Team at third base. The Daisies won the title with a 66–39 mark. The explosive bats of Wilma Briggs and the sisters Betty Weaver Foss and Joanne Weaver provided the difference in the league. Briggs belted a league-lead nine homers, while Joanne led in average (.346) and Betty in RBI (81) and stolen bases (80), but Fort Wayne lost for the third consecutive year in the first round, now with the Kalamazoo Lassies, 2-to-1. In the All-Star Game, played on July 14 at Memorial Park, the Daisies defeated the All-Star team in an 11-inning effort behind Jean Geissinger, who belted a walk-off home run, and Horstman, whose relief pitching silenced an All-Stars potential rally in the 9th inning.

Jones opened 1951 with Rockford but was traded to the Battle Creek Belles during the midseason. In 1952, she was asked to pitch because the Belles had two injured pitchers and also had catcher Rita Briggs.

Following the 1977 Europeans, the Romanian Gymnastics Federation removed Comăneci from her longtime coaches, the Károlyis, and sent her to Bucharest to train at the August 23 sports complex. The change was not positive for Comăneci. Grappling with both the stress of her parents' divorce and the new training environment, she was extremely unhappy and her gymnastics and overall fitness suffered. Comăneci competed in the 1978 World Championships in Strasbourg looking heavier and out of shape; she was also several inches taller than in Montreal. A fall from the uneven bars resulted in a fourth-place finish in the all-around behind Soviets Elena Mukhina, Nellie Kim, and Natalia Shaposhnikova. Comăneci did win the world title on beam, and a silver on vault.

Missing from the 1980 Olympics was the 1978 World Champion, Elena Mukhina, who had been paralysed after an accident while training. She was unable to speak for 6 months and remained in a wheelchair until her death in December 2006. Davydova kept in contact with her and Mukhina described her as "a real friend". Mukhina was not expected to be on the USSR team.In 1979 she had broken her leg and it didn't set right. She was unable to master her old skills. In the spring of 1980 the Soviets split the senior elites into 2 groups - those who were on the Olympic squad and those that weren't. Mukhina had not competed for the first 6 months of 1980 until she finished 14th AA at the USSR Cup. Mukhina was in the 2nd group training in Minsk when the accident happened.

The skill can be performed on the uneven bars, where gymnast, from a stand on the high bar, performs a back flip, and regrasps the bar. Korbut performed the move at the 1972 Summer Olympics, where it was the first backward release move performed on the uneven bars in international competition. In 1977, Soviet gymnast Elena Mukhina modified the flip by adding a full twist. The movement was later modified in the 1980s when it was performed towards the low bar; that is, the gymnast's flip takes place above the low bar. The Korbut Flip on uneven bars is no longer allowed in gymnastics competition because it involves standing on the high bar, a maneuver which is now illegal in the Code of Points, because it interrupts the rhythm created by swinging movements.

After losing the two opening matches of the 1891 Home Nations Championship, the Wales selection committee brought in four new forwards into the Welsh pack to face Ireland on 7 March. Three, Tom Deacon and John and David Samuel, were from Swansea RFC; with Nicholl taking the remaining position. Played at Stradey Park, the game was only decided by a goal conversion from Billy Bancroft, giving Wales the victory and Ireland the wooden spoon. From that match, Nicholl became a regular fixture in the Welsh pack. Of his 15 caps for Wales he only missed one international match over a 16 game run, taking in five Home Nations Championships. Most notably, Nicholls was part of the 1893 team which saw Wales not only win the Championship, but lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. The next year's tournament saw Nicholl play the first two matches against England and Scotland, but then miss the final game away to Ireland, his place taken by Neath's Fred Hutchinson. Nicholl played in all three matches of the 1895 Championship, but 1896 saw a shift in the selection tactics employed by the Welsh Rugby Union. After a humiliating defeat by England in the opening game of the 1896 Championship the selectors decided to discard many of the forward players who had served Wales over the past four seasons, including Triple Crown winners like Wallace Watts and Arthur Boucher, favouring a new type of player emerging from the South Wales coalfields. Dubbed the 'Rhondda forward', these players were selected from tough manual workers who could not only scrummage and jump, but could take and respond to a more physical game. Although a product of the university system, Nicholl was well known for his hard style of play, and survived until the end of the season but was replaced by Llwynypia's Dick Hellings in 1897.	The next year's tournament saw Nicholl play the first two matches against England and Scotland, but then miss the final game away to Ireland, his place taken by Neath's Fred Hutchinson.	/m/05zs0qd	Fred_Hutchinson_(rugby_player)	169	184	/people/deceased_person,/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete
Nicholl first played rugby for Llandovery College, following his older brother Charles Nicholl. Unlike Charles, Nicholl did not go to university and settled in Llanelli as a bank cashier. Nicholl represented Llanelli at club level, and in 1894, he was selected for his one and only international cap for the Welsh national team. The match was played against Ireland as part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship, and Nicholl, along with Jack Elliott and Neath's Fred Hutchinson. Wales lost the game by a single penalty goal, the game having slowed due to a very boggy Belfast pitch.

There was a controversy about the team members chosen for the Barcelona Olympics some weeks after the European Championships. The ex-USSR countries went to the competition as a Unified Team. Oxana Kostina was the favorite to go and had a better competitive season, many speculated that Kostina would replace Skaldina in the Olympics but Skaldina was named to the team instead. She finished 3rd in the All-Around in Barcelona.

In September, Kanaeva competed at the World Championships in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Kanaeva qualified for the individual all-around final by placing first in every single apparatus, each with a gold medal. Her results in individual apparatuses (along with those of her teammates Olga Kapranova, Daria Kondakova, and Daria Dmitrieva) helped win the team gold for Russia. In the individual all-around final, Kanaeva won her sixth gold medal by a margin of 0.600, beating by one the record set by Russian gymnast Oxana Kostina in 1992 of most gold medals won in a single rhythmic gymnastics World Championship. President Medvedev again acknowledged Kanaeva's new record by sending her a telegram of congratulations.

Millward began his professional career in September 1964, signing for his home town club Castleford Tigers. He made his debut on 3 October 1964 against Dewsbury and won his first domestic honours in 1965 with Castleford picking up the Floodlit Trophy. Millward played in the position of Stand-off/Five-eighth and, due to the importance of such a position in rugby league, and due to the fact there were many more experienced players in the Castleford side at that time (such as Alan Hardisty and Keith Hepworth) Millward found it hard to break into the first team for any length of time. Despite his lack of game experience, the International selectors were interested in Millward and picked him to play for the Great Britain national team in March 1966 against France at the age of 18 and one of Great Britain's youngest players.

The 1973 Final was to be the last time a play-off system would be used to determine the British champions until 1998's Super League season. The match was played on 19 May 1973 at Bradford's Odsal Stadium between the previous season's champions, Leeds and first-time finalists, Dewsbury. Dewsbury had suffered a county cup record defeat 36-9 at the hands of Leeds in the Yorkshire Cup final earlier in the season. Also Leeds had finished 3rd on the ladder and Dewsbury 8th. However, Dewsbury opened up a 12-4 lead by the interval with tries by the hooker Mike Stephenson and Allan Agar and two goals and a drop-goal from the boot of centre Nigel Stephenson. Leeds captain Alan Hardisty was sent off for the first time in his career for a high tackle on John Bates.

Ricky Walford was one of a dying breed of goal kicker in top line rugby league. He was an old style direct 'toe poker' of the ball rather than the 'around-the-corner' style which gives the kicker greater accuracy and has proved much more popular since Englishman John Gray introduced the style to Australia when he joined The Bears in 1975.

Chronometers were ‘rated’ for accuracy at the annual trials in Greenwich – success was often lucratively rewarded with contracts from private and public sectors. Tom came second at the Greenwich Trials in 1881. The following year, his son Frank Mercer was born, who in later years won Greenwich first prize in 1911 with Mercer 8306. It was bought by Astronomer Royal Frank Dyson for the Greenwich Observatory. Thomas Mercer Chronometers sold many ‘white label’ pieces to middlemen, retailers who would put their own name on the dial of a chronometer made completely by TMC. Many of these were very successful at the Greenwich Trials, but the prizes did not go to TMC. Before judging an horological competition in Paris, Tom caught an infection and died there in 1900.

Match: At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and Llanelli feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players. Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time, and out of the 15 man team only William Towers and William Bowen from Swansea and Dan Griffiths of Llanelli were chosen by the Welsh Rugby Union. This was exasperated by the fact the match was played in Swansea, and it is believed that the lack of local players led to a poor crowd with gate receipts of only £120 recorded.

Griffiths came to note as a rugby player when playing for club team Llanelli. In 1888 Griffiths was part of the Llanelli squad who faced the first touring Southern Hemisphere rugby team, the New Zealand Natives. Griffiths was constant in rushes against the Maoris, and the game was decided by a single long range dropped goal from Llanelli's Harry Bowen. Griffiths was later selected for the Welsh national team, partnered with Newport's Charlie Thomas, in a match against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. The Welsh team on that day included four Llanelli players, Griffith's team-mates being Tom Morgan, Dan Griffiths and Ned Roberts, all four playing their final international match. The game was played at St. Helen's and the Wales team was captained for the first time by rugby superstar Arthur 'Monkey' Gould. Wales lost the game by two tries to nil and in the next game Griffiths was replaced by William Stadden, and never represented his country again.

Morgan was one of a small group of players from Llanelli Rugby Club, who gained international caps in the late 1880s, but played little more than a handful of games. Morgan played just a single game for his country, a home match at St. Helen's in Swansea, against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Among the Welsh team on that day were four Llanelli players, though none had been selected for the opening game of the tournament against Scotland. Morgan's club team-mates for that match included Giotto Griffiths, Ned Roberts and Dan Griffiths. This would be the last international game for all four players. Ireland won the game by two tries to nil, both of the scores coming from Irish debuts. Morgan lost his place in the Welsh squad the next season to Penarth's Dickie Garrett, and didn't play for Wales again.

Roberts was reselected at halfback for the very next Wales international, in the second and final Welsh game of the 1888 Championship, away to Ireland. Under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, the Welsh team faced an international opposition for the final time playing with three threequarters system, but lost heavily. Roberts was not part of the 1888 Wales team that faced the touring New Zealand Natives, but Roberts also failed to make the Llanelli team that faced the same tourists three days prior. In the opening game of the 1889 Home Nations Championship the fullback position was filled by Cardiff's Hugh 'Sawdust' Hughes, but the next game saw Roberts retake his place at fullback. Roberts was one of four Llanelli players that were brought into the squad, but he, Giotto Griffiths, Dan Griffiths and Tom Morgan would never play another international game. The Irish won the game with two tries, both scored by debut players.

The 1893 Home Nations Championship was in stark contrast to the previous year for the Welsh, with Wales winning not only the Championship for the first time, but also winning the Triple Crown and Gould being the first Welsh captain to lead his team to these achievements. The first match of the campaign was against England. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, the pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers being employed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with conditions further hampered by a strong wind. The English team played the first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum dominated the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7-0 down, with tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain A.E. Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales, with Marshall scoring a second try from excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after Marshall's try. The English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in the first half of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the half way line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed. The Welsh backs continually exposed the three threequarter system, as once the Welsh backs broke through the pack there was little cover to prevent run away scores. With the score at 7-9 to England, Marshall extended the lead with his third try of the match. This gave England an 11-7 lead with only ten minutes remaining. The game swung again when Percy Phillips took a swift heeled ball and passed to Gould. Gould broke through the English defence and scored, though again Bancroft missed the conversion. With further Welsh pressure, a penalty was awarded to Wales on the English 25-yard line, but at a wide angle. Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Gould tried to place the ball for Bancroft, but failed on the frozen ground, other state that Bancroft defied his captain to take the penalty as a drop kick, while other accounts mention Bancroft and Gould arguing on the pitch before Bancroft's attempt. Whichever event, Bancroft kicked the penalty, the first penalty to be scored in an international match. It was the final score of the game and Wales were victorious, by twelve points to eleven.

Rowles had played for Penarth for several years before his international selection in 1892, he was senior team captain during the 1885/86 season, and is recorded as being a member of the Penarth team that won the Cardiff District Cup in 1888. Rowles won his only Welsh cap when he was chosen to partner Newport's Percy Phillips in the opening game of the 1892 Home Nations Championship against England. The preferred halfback partnership for Wales were the Swansea pairing of Evan and David James, but with the James brothers unavailable, Rowles was given his opportunity. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales were outclassed by England who won by three goals and a try to nil. The next match the James brother were brought back in and Rowles and Phillips lost their places; though Phillips would represent his country on a further five occasions, Rowles never played for Wales again.

Davies played club rugby for first class Welsh team, Llanelli, and it was while representing the 'Scarlets' that he was first selected to play for Wales. Wales had used the Newport half-back pairing of Percy Phillips and Fred Parfitt, but after the retirement of Phillips, the selectors began experimenting with new pairings. The opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship against England saw the introduction of two new caps into the half-back positions, Davies and Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs. Despite experienced and talented backs, including Billy Bancroft, Tom Pearson and captain Arthur Gould, the weak forward play from Wales left the backs hamstrung, and the team lost 6-14. The next game of the Championship saw the selectors retain Biggs, but Davies was replaced by a returning Fred Parfitt.

In October, Smitherman picked up support. Sarah Thomson dropped out and endorsed Smitherman. Smitherman and his staff were also pressing some of Rocco Rossi’s key supporters to switch; Rossi soon dropped out due to being unable to improve poll numbers but did not endorse any other candidates. Former Toronto (pre-amalgamation) mayors David Crombie and Art Eggleton also endorsed Smitherman. Several left-leaning councilors who were normally allies of Joe Pantalone, Joe Mihevc, Adam Vaughan, and Pam McConnell, decided to back Smitherman's campaign instead. Smitherman urged strategic voting and repeatedly asserted that "a vote for Joe Pantalone is a vote for Rob Ford". Smitherman also left a voice-mail for outgoing Mayor David Miller, hoping that Miller would persuade Pantalone to bow out, but Miller never returned the call (back in 2003, Barbara Hall's campaign used back-channel efforts to discourage Miller's run for mayor) and gave a public endorsement of Pantalone instead. Following the results of the October 18 Angus Reid Public Opinion Poll, Smitherman and Ford were practically tied for first place, with Ford at 41% and Smitherman at 40%.

The concept of a Gaelic Athletic Association was first mooted in 1883 when a sub-committee of the Irish Republican Brotherhood was formed with the ideal of creating a National Athletic body. Midleton man, P.N Fitzgerald was one of the committee members who eventually set up the Gaelic Athletic Association and thus Midleton's love affair and commitment to the G.A.A. was established. The club was formally affiliated to the association, when at the third meeting of the fledgling organisation, held in Thurles on the 17th January 1885; Jeremiah J Coffey formally registered the club as Midleton Football club. The club blossomed in the early years and in 1890 brought the first senior football All Ireland title to Cork under the captaincy of Jim Power. This was an historic year in the annals of Cork G.A.A. as the hurlers, under the Aghabullogue banner also brought the hurling title to the Leeside. Exactly 100 years later their modern day counterparts repeated this historic feat of winning the two All Ireland senior titles in the one year. Two Midleton players, Kevin Hennessy and Ger FitzGerald, were instrumental in guiding the hurlers to their victory in 1990. The club purchased its present location from Lord Midleton in 1958 and has continuously upgraded its facilities in the meantime to make it the capital of sporting venues in East Cork and one of the finest arenas in the country. In 1975 the club's pavilion was opened and since its completion has played a vital role for the GAA and other sporting and cultural organisations within the greater East Cork area. Following this, the club entered its greatest period in its history on the playing fields. When the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship was annexed in 1978 the club went from strength to strength culminating in winning the All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship title in 1987. Along the way, every county hurling title was won from underage to senior with the 1983 victory over St.Finbarrs being the most treasured. This was beyond the wildest dreams of anyone within the club, but the players proved it was not a one off wonder when they fulfilled their potential by winning three other Cork Senior Hurling Championship titles in 1986, 87 and 91 beating the cream of Cork hurling along the way. By winning the title in 1983 the club were rewarded with the captaincy of the Cork team for 1984, the centenary year of the Association. In that year the club became only the second club in the history of the G.A.A. to provide All Ireland winning senior captains in both hurling and football when John Fenton captained Cork to All Ireland victory over Offaly in Thurles. There were five other Midleton players on the Cork panel that year with Joe Desmond being chairman of the selection committee. The 1980s and early 90s were great years for the club but after the feast came some lean years. However, following tremendous work at street league level and in the schools success is starting to flow again. While the expanding population around the area will bring its own opportunities and problems the members of Midleton G.A.A. club are determined to keep the flag of the association flying proudly within the town and where ever the games of hurling and football will take them.

Thomas began his rugby playing career for local clubs across the Swansea area, before joining Morriston. Morriston was well known for providing players to first class club Swansea, and in 1892 Thomas too joined the team. Despite joining Swansea in 1892, it took until 1900 for him to be selected for the Wales national squad, joining the team in the opening match of the 1900 Home Nations Championship, played at Gloucester against England. The Welsh team saw an influx of new players, mainly brought into the back positions, but Thomas was one of two new caps in the forwards, along with Pontymister's William Williams. Wales won the game 13-3, and the Welsh selector's reacted by keeping faith with the Welsh forwards for the next game, apart from the enforced change of Dick Hellings. Played at Swansea's home ground at St. Helens, Thomas was part of the Welsh team to beat Scotland in another convincing win, this time by 12 points to three. The final game of the Championship was played at Belfast against Ireland, and with the Hellings returning the pack was back to the same line up as the first game of the tournament. A single try by Welsh centre George Davies gave Wales the win and their second Triple Crown, and made Thomas a Championship winning player.

In took another three seasons for Davies to be reselected for Wales again, but in the second Welsh match of the 1901 Championship, he was brought into the pack as a replacement for Pontymister's William Willams. Although the team had won the opening game of the tournament against England, doubts were raised in the press over the cohesion of the Welsh pack, and this proved founded when Wales collapsed towards the end of the match to allow a Scottish victory. Davies played in one more match for Wales, in the final game of the 1901 season, facing Ireland at his club's ground, St. Helen's. Wales won a tight game, but Davies was dropped for the next Championship and did not represent Wales again.

Evans spent his entire rugby career with unfashionable Monmouthsire club Blaina, turning down several approaches by professional rugby league clubs to 'go North'. He had an immense loyalty to his home club and spent his entire life in the village where he was born. In 1904 Evans received his one and only international call-up, becoming the first player to be directly capped from Blaina RFC. Evans was brought into the Wales team to face England in the opening game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship, captained by Cardiff's Gwyn Nicholls. Evans was only one of two news caps in the Welsh squad for the encounter, the other being David John Thomas from Swansea; both men coming into the pack. The game ended in a draw, after a late try from Teddy Morgan was disallowed to prevent a Welsh victory. The Welsh selectors responded by bringing in five new caps for the next match, and Evans was one of those replaced.

In 1946/47, the Rugby Football League drew up the fixture list but Leigh's name was omitted and it was only when local businessman James Hilton made a personal and impassioned plea to the Rugby Football League that Leigh were included. In January 1946, a public meeting at Leigh Liberal Club approved a motion to re-launch the club as Leigh RLFC. In 1947, the club moved to Kirkhall Lane headquarters and in 1953 floodlights were installed at a cost of £4,100. The ground saw a record home crowd of 31,326 attend a Challenge Cup tie with St Helens in the same year. Later, Kirkhall Lane was officially renamed Hilton Park after James Hilton.

Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition; however, the game turned into a rout.

New full-forward Eoin Liston scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off.

The original colours used by Transvaal were dark blue and white jerseys, blue shorts and blue-and-white socks. It is unsure when the union decided to switch over to a white jersey with a red hoop with black shorts and socks. There is also a school of thought that the union adopted the famous Kilmarnock strip of white top with red hoop as a Kilmarnock member, Alex Frew, captained them when they beat The British Isles touring team in 1903. These colours are still in use today. It is also from these colours that the teams’ nickname, “Rooibontes” came from.

Since the change in league structure to embrace professionalism, Killie have struggled to hold onto their better players and now languish in Division 2 of the BT National Leagues, effectively the old Division 5. An interesting tale surrounds the first recorded use of air travel by a club when some players chartered a plane to fly to Jedburgh to fulfil a fixture some 50 years ago. It is also likely that Killie took part in the first floodlit rugby match at Rugby Park, now the home of Kilmarnock FC. There is also a school of thought that South African team Transvaal, now the Golden Lions Super Rugby team, adopted the famous Kilmarnock strip of white top with red hoop as a Kilmarnock member, Alex Frew, captained them when they beat The British Isles touring team in 1903. Frew was also a Scottish Internationalist whilst at Edinburgh University.

But Nigel Hunt had passed a fitness test, it ment that Chad would miss out on the tournament. At age 26, Tuoro went on to make his international debut for the side in Hong Kong along with North Harbour winger Nafi Tuitavake.

Carey has also been the recipient of many awards and honours off the field. In 1993 his hurling prowess earned him the prestigious Texaco Hurler of the Year award. Seven years later in 2000 he received this honour for the second time as well as being presented with the Eircell Hurler of the Year award. There was some mild surprise when Carey was omitted from the GAA Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000. He was, however, named in the left wing-forward position on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century. In 2002 Carey equalled Pat Spillane's record by collecting a ninth All Star award (this record was subsequently surpassed in 2011 by Henry Shefflin when he won a record—for both Gaelic football and hurling—10th All Star Award).

The third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of Freeport, Bahamas. Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion. The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors - UK runner-ups Lynn Davies and Dave Boy Green and Irish Superstars champion Pat Spillane. The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury. If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, Wayne Grimditch, Jim Taylor and Joe Theismann all qualifying. Completing the line-up were two invited challengers - not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though. Instead the organisers had asked both Emerson Fittipaldi and Rafael Septien to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success. They did however represent Brazil and Mexico respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in Latin America. They would have little impact on the final.

In 1978, Kerry once again faced little competition in the Provincial Championship. A 3-14 to 3-7 defeat of Cork gave Ó Sé a fourth Munster medal in-a-row. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition; however, the game turned into a rout. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy's sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed over the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. New full-forward Eoin Liston scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the winners by 5-11 to 0-9.

Ó Sé's fellow Kerry legend Pat Spillane said he was "heartbroken". John Mahoney, who both played against and managed against Ó Sé, said he was "deeply shocked". Dara Ó Cinnéide described the deceased as “an exception to every rule”. Joe Kernan, whose Armagh team triumphed over Ó Sé's Kerry team in the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, said: “The reaction to his death up here in Ulster has been incredible. Every GAA man, woman and child in any part of the country felt they knew Páidí. He was just one of those great characters that people loved. It's hard to believe he's gone.” Little Colm Cooper, who first played for Kerry when Ó Sé was manager, was said to be devastated.

For the 2012 season, Grosjean moved to the Lotus (formerly Renault) Formula One team, and Varhaug switched to the Auto GP World Series; they were replaced by series veteran Davide Valsecchi and reigning British F3 champion Felipe Nasr. Valsecchi began the season strongly, winning an unprecedented three races in a row in Bahrain, and later prevailed over closest rival Luiz Razia to win the championship, whilst Nasr finished on the podium four times to finish tenth in the championship, the second-highest rookie behind James Calado. Between them, Valsecchi and Nasr scored enough points to win DAMS's first GP2 Teams' Championship, six points ahead of ART, competing under the Lotus GP banner.

Arden again took part in the Asia Series for the 2008–09 season, signing Luiz Razia and Mika Mäki. For the second round of the championship, held at the Dubai Autodrome, Mäki was replaced by Renger van der Zande, who was subsequently replaced for the rest of the season by Edoardo Mortara. Razia scored the team's only win of the campaign, which allowed Arden to finish sixth in the teams' championship. For the 2009 main series season, the team signed F3 frontrunners Sergio Pérez and Mortara. This was also another poor season for the team, as it finished well down the order in eighth place overall with only Mortara managing a single win.

For the 2011 season, ART reached an agreement with Lotus Cars to run under the Lotus ART moniker. The team switched from its traditional white-and-red livery to a Team Lotus-inspired green-and-yellow scheme, although this was somewhat confusing as Lotus Cars (sponsoring the Renault team) was involved in a legal dispute in Formula One with a new incarnation of Team Lotus (now Caterham) over the use of the name. Team Lotus was also competing with a green-and-yellow livery, whereas Renault (competing as Lotus Renault GP) was running a black-and-gold colour scheme reminiscent of the original Team Lotus's association with John Player Specials. As for the drivers, Bianchi was retained alongside Esteban Gutiérrez, who was promoted to GP2 after winning the inaugural GP3 Series championship with ART. Bianchi retained his third place in the championship but his season was slightly disappointing as he failed to mount a championship challenge despite his greater experience and his status as a pre-season favourite, whilst Gutiérrez played himself in with a single victory on his way to 13th place in the championship. ART again slipped to fifth in the teams' championship. The deal with Lotus was extended for the 2012 season, with the team name adjusted to Lotus GP and the colour scheme now altered to match the black-and-gold livery used by the Lotus F1 team, the Renault name having been dropped and the dispute with Caterham solved. With Bianchi moving to the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, another ART GP3 graduate, James Calado, was signed to partner Gutiérrez. The second-year driver improved to third place in the drivers' championship with three victories, albeit someway behind title protagonists Davide Valsecchi and Luiz Razia, whilst Calado impressed by winning twice and finishing fifth overall as the season's top rookie driver.

During 2009, the team was sold and all remaining ties with part-owner Nelson Piquet were severed. The team was rebranded "Rapax" (Latin for "predator") at the beginning of 2010, after the Legio XXI Rapax Roman legion. Pastor Maldonado rejoined the team, alongside Luiz Razia. Maldonado won six races on his way to the drivers' championship, and Razia backed him up with 11th place overall, allowing Rapax to win the teams' championship for the first time, and in the first year of its new identity. For 2011, Maldonado graduated to Formula One with the Williams team and Razia moved to the new Caterham Team AirAsia; Rapax signed Fabio Leimer and Julián Leal to replaced them. Leimer won a single race but was unable build on it, restricting him to fourteenth place in the drivers' championship, whilst Leal did not score at all; Rapax dropped to tenth in the teams' championship. In 2012, the team improved to ninth overall through the combined efforts of Tom Dillmann, Stefano Coletti, Ricardo Teixeira and Daniël de Jong. Dillmann was the most successful with a single victory, but was dropped for budgetary reasons mid-season and replaced by De Jong. De Jong's Auto GP racing commitments also resulted in him missing the final two races of the championship, for which he was replaced by Scuderia Coloni refugee Coletti. By contrast, Teixeira competed in all but one round of the season, but failed to score any points.

Zuber returned to FMS for the 2009 GP2 Series season, where he was partnered by Luiz Razia. Despite scoring more podium finishes, the year was unstable off-track: first Giancarlo Fisichella's stake in the team was bought back by the Coloni family, its original founder and owner; then the outfit missed the eighth round of the championship after its cars were impounded as a result of court proceedings initiated by driver Andy Soucek, who had briefly been employed by FMS. Zuber eventually wound up in thirteenth place overall.

In 2009, Soucek raced in the newly-revived FIA Formula Two Championship, driving car number 22. Soucek clinched the title with three races to spare. As part of his prize for winning the championship, he tested for the Williams Formula One team on December 1, setting the fastest time of the day. Soucek was confident of landing a Williams reserve drive in 2010. However Williams signed Valtteri Bottas as their official reserve and test driver. But Williams' loss was Virgin Racing's gain as on 23 February 2010, they announced that Soucek will join Luiz Razia as a test and reserve driver. In August, Soucek left Virgin, stating that the team had broken their contract by not giving him any testing opportunities.

Hülkenberg continued with ART into the 2009 GP2 Series season (partnering Pastor Maldonado), and took his first win in dominant fashion, during his home round of the series at the Nürburgring. With the series' top eight inverted grid, Hülkenberg started eighth for the sprint race. He won the sprint race as well, becoming the first driver to do the weekend double since Giorgio Pantano at Monza in the 2006 season. In doing so, he became only the second driver to complete the clean sweep, with pole position, two fastest laps and two wins; equalling the achievements of Nelson Piquet, Jr., who achieved it at the Hungaroring, also in 2006. Hülkenberg clinched the title with two races to spare, after a third place finish in the Monza sprint race, shadowing Brazilians Luiz Razia and Lucas di Grassi home. The result left him with an unassailable 22-point lead heading to the final round, and in the process becoming the first driver to clinch the championship without the need for a final round decider. A fifth win followed at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, allowing the German to break the 100-point barrier, and eventually won the title by 25 points from Vitaly Petrov. Worthy of note is that Hülkenberg ended the season 64 points clear of his team mate Pastor Maldonado, who would later go on to get his Williams race seat for the 2011 F1 season.

In February 2007, Risatti was announced as a GP2 Series driver with BCN Competicion, but this position was later taken by Ho-Pin Tung. He instead competed in the World Series by Renault with GD (Great Dane) Racing. Risatti had a second chance to make his GP2 series debut when Pastor Maldonado broke his collarbone during training. Risatti competed with Trident Racing at Istanbul Park in Turkey and Monza in Italy. During this time, Luiz Razia substituted for Risatti in the World Series by Renault.

He finished seventh in the Asia series, losing his championship to Romain Grosjean. In the main series, he took the team's first victory in the Monaco feature race, and also set his first fastest lap in the category. After another double points finish at Valencia, however, he failed to score in the remaining ten races, slipping back to eighth in the championship and equalling his previous year's result.

Australian Royce Simmons took over from compatriot Mick Potter for the start of the 2011 season. As the club awaited completion of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th successive Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances.

On the 16th March 2011 it was announced on the St. Helens website that he had been suspended by the club pending an investigation into serious misconduct. The club also said that no further comments will be made until the completion of the investigation. It was confirmed by the club that he made an inappropriate gesture to his home fans, and it looked unlikely he would ever play in the red V again, especially after the emergence of scrum-half sensation Jonny Lomax and stand-off Lee Gaskell. He was dropped to the under-18s team. However injuries struck Saints, and they called upon Kyle to fill in. He was playing under difficult circumstances, with Saints fans booing him with every touch of the ball, however he made a decent return. In July 2011 he successfully made the switch from the halfbacks to fullback, scoring 2 tries against Wakefield Trinity on 9 July. Since then Kyle has regained his confidence and is playing in a similar way to the 2008-09 seasons. He has so far managed 15 appearances and scored 5 tries, but reduced to just 4 goal kicks (3 missed kicks) due to Jamie Foster replacing him as the club's kicker.

As with many extreme sports, luging is not without its risks. Though most injuries involve bumps, bruises, broken bones, and concussions, fatalities do occasionally occur. The most recent was Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili who suffered a fatal crash during his final practice run for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. Hours after the incident, the International Luge Federation concluded that the accident was caused by a steering error and not a track error. Nevertheless, changes to the track were made before the re-opening. Kumaritashvili was the fourth athlete to die while in preparation for a Winter Olympics competition, following speed skier Nicolas Bochatay, 27, who died while preparing for the Albertville 1992 games, British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and skier Ross Milne, 19, who both died in the run up to the Innsbruck 1964 games.

Speed skiing was a demonstration sport at the 1992 Winter Olympics. The venue was in Les Arcs, about 60 km from the host city Albertville. Michael Prufer, a 31 year old medical doctor from Savoie, improved his own 1988 world record by 5.558 km/h. Philippe Goitschel, the nephew of French ski champion Marielle Goitschel was second and the American Jeffrey Hamilton was third. The competition was however marred by the death of Nicolas Bochatay from Switzerland who died while free skiing the morning of the finals.

Investigations conducted the same day concluded that the accident was not caused by deficiencies in the track. As a preventative measure, the walls at the exit of curve 16 were to be raised and a change in the ice profile would be made. A joint statement was issued by the FIL, the International Olympic Committee, and the Vancouver Organizing Committee over Kurmaitasvili's death with training suspended for the rest of that day. According to the Coroners Service of British Columbia and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the cause was to Kumaritashvili coming out of turn 15 late and not compensating for turn 16. Because of this fatality, an extra 40 yd (37 m) of wall was added after the end of Turn 16 and the ice profile was changed. It also moved the men's singles luge event from its starthouse to the one for both the women's singles and men's doubles event. Kumaritashvili is the first Olympic athlete to die at the Winter Olympics in training since the death of Nicolas Bochatay during a speed skiing practice at the 1992 Winter Olympics and the first luger to die in a practice event at the Winter Olympics since Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski of Great Britain was killed at the luge track used for the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. It was also luge's first fatality (on an artificial track) since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger was killed. Kumaritavili's teammate Levan Gureshidze withdrew prior to the first run of the event.

Nodar David Kumaritashvili (Georgian: ნოდარ დავით ქუმარიტაშვილი; pronounced ; November 25, 1988 – February 12, 2010) was a Georgian luger who suffered a fatal crash during a training run for the 2010 Winter Olympics competition in Whistler, Canada, on the day of the opening ceremony. He became the fourth athlete to have died during Winter Olympics preparations, after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski, Australian skier Ross Milne (both Innsbruck 1964), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (Albertville 1992), and the sixth athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.

Medics were at his side within seconds of the crash. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation began within one minute, and a plastic breathing tube was inserted into his mouth. He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries. It was luge's first fatality since December 10, 1975 when an Italian luger was killed. Kumaritashvili's final run had been his 25th on the Whistler track, and his 13th from the men's start. Some United Kingdom newspapers blamed the crash on Canada's aggressive Own the Podium program, which had given Canadian athletes more time to train at the Olympic venues to the detriment of Olympians from other countries. Kumaritashvili was the fourth athlete to ever die during the Winter Olympics preparations, after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski, Australian skier Ross Milne (both Innsbruck 1964), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (Albertville 1992), and the sixth athlete to die in the Summer or Winter Olympics.

After an average season in 1994, the inaugural coach, Graham Cornes, was sacked and replaced by a Victorian, Robert Shaw, who coached the Crows for the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Adelaide managed to sign the gifted Darren Jarman, brother of Andrew back from Hawthorn for the 1996 season. The two brothers were excited to be playing side by side again, having done so with success for North Adelaide in the SANFL. After yet another unsuccessful year, Shaw was replaced by former SANFL and VFL player Malcolm Blight. One of Blight's first moves upon taking the job was clearing the decks at the Crows. Chris McDermott (who had just retired), Tony McGuinness (captain) and Andrew Jarman were told they were no longer required at the club. Although this marked the end of the Jarman brothers combination at the Crows, Darren Jarman would go on to play a pivotal role in the club's success during the following two years.

Blight's arrival at the Crows at the end of the 1996 season was marked with dramatic effect, with the delisting of four ageing club stalwarts Tony McGuinness, Chris McDermott, Andrew Jarman, and Greg Anderson. This attracted great criticism at the time, but Blight was vindicated by winning the AFL premiership in 1997, and again in 1998. He retired as coach at the end of the 1999 season after an unsuccessful year finishing 13th. To commemorate his legacy as Adelaide's first premiership coach, the club named their annual Best and Fairest award the Malcolm Blight Medal.

After the retirement of Broncos' great Darren Lockyer, Hunt was nominated alongside fellow teammate Corey Norman to fill the vacant five-eighth position. The pair battled out in the trials but Hunt eventually lost out to Norman, leaving Hunt on the bench once again for Round 1, 2012. In Round 7, against the Raiders, Hunt and Norman both got the chance to showcase their skills on the centre stage with regular halfback Peter Wallace a late withdrawal through injury. Norman and Hunt didn't disappoint with the pair combining beautifully as the Broncos ran out 30-6 winners. With Hunt managing to get on the try-scorers' list. After the Broncos stumbled at the back end of 2012, losing 7 of 10 games en route to the finals, Hunt found himself in the five-eighth role with Norman dropped to the bench following poor form. Despite playing quite well, Hunt found himself back on the bench as the Broncos were knocked out in the first week of the finals losing 33-16 against the North Queensland Cowboys.

From 1903 it was the venue for the Good Friday meeting organised by the Southern Counties Cycle Union. World champions have performed at Good Friday meetings, which during the 1920s and 1930s attracted attendances of 10,000. National and world records have been established there – Norwood Paragon's Frank Southall was a notable record-breaker in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1936 the tandem pairing from Addiscombe C.C. - Ernie Mills and Bill Paul set a world best of 30 miles 793 yards, unpaced in one hour, although no tandem figures were recognised by the governing body at that time.	- Ernie Mills and Bill Paul set a world best of 30 miles 793 yards, unpaced in one hour, although no tandem figures were recognised by the governing body at that time.	/m/0ggb3nv	Bill_Paul_(cyclist)	18	27	/people/deceased_person,/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete

Berger then told Simpson that if he wanted to be a successful road cyclist, he first needed to ride the track, in particular the 4000 m individual pursuit event. He travelled regularly to compete at Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester, where in early-1956, he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist, Cyril Cartwright, who believed Simpson had a chance of winning that year's national pursuit championship. Cartwright advised him on dieting, lent him a track bike and developed his technique; the 1948 Olympic silver medallist, Reg Harris, was brought in to train with Simpson. In the national championships at Fallowfield, Simpson won the silver in the individual pursuit; he beat reigning amateur world champion Norman Sheil on the way to the final, where he was beaten by Mike Gambrill.

After three years of racing under Series Production regulations (1970–1972) the Toby Lee Series switched to sports sedans during the 1973 and 1974 seasons. 1973 saw competitive racing with big fields. Leading contenders included John Harvey and Colin Bond in Torana Repco V8s, Bill Brown and Jim McKeown driving Porsche Carreras, Leo Geoghegan's Porsche 911S, and Allan Moffat's famous Trans-Am Mustang. But when John McCormack rolled out his highly modified Ansett Charger Repco V8 in 1974 it dominated the series. This led to a lessening of interest in the series and the fields dwindled in the second half of 1974.

Cleveland Panthers. The Panthers had existed as an independent team since 1919, mostly playing teams from upstate New York. Coached by Roy Watts, the Panthers featured six players who played for the NFL’s Cleveland Bulldogs in the 1925 season: Al Michaels, Al Nesser, Dick Wolf, Dave Noble, Ralph Vince, and Doc Elliott. Despite having a potent offense and a winning record, the Panthers drew poorly at home aside from the league-opening game. The team left the AFL hours after losing to the Los Angeles Wildcats road team on October 31; they would return to independent status until folding in 1933.

On 15 December 2011. Coach Dejan Udovičić announced a wider squad for the upcoming European Championships in Eindhoven. He said that the competition will be important as a last check before the main event of the season - the Olympic Games in London. "The group is difficult but I am satisfied. The most important thing is to see what are our options before the Olympic Games in London. Of course we all want to attack the first place, it is our debt to the previous generations of Serbian water polo, and those who come," said Udovičić at a press conference in Belgrade. Serbia's coach revealed that the "dolphin's" first training will be on 17 December and that the whole squad will be present except Mikić who still has obligations with his team. From 8 January they will go on a trip to Greece on a tournament where they will meet with Greece, Montenegro and Spain.

On 27 January Serbia defeated the current world champion, Italy, with 8:12 (5:4, 1:4, 1:3, 1:1) and thus qualified for the finals. This game began with nine goals marking the first eight minutes. Since Slobodan Soro received five goals, coach Dejan Udovičić replaced him before the end of the first quarter with Branislav Mitrović. The goal of young debutant Šaponjić was enough to tie at 5:5. From the 6-6 tie, Serbia water polo players begun to hold a lesson in modern versions of the sport to a team that is the current world champion. It was not revenge for defeat in the final of 2011 Shanghai, it was a simple lesson, which consisted of three phases - solid defense, a wise selection of moves in the attack and forceful implementation. This is exactly what has brought five consecutive goals for Serbia national team, of which the famous rival did not recover.

In 1917, Bob Nash promised an "Ohio League" championship to the fans in Massillon. In doing so he put together an offensive line that included Charlie Copley at tackle and Al Wesbecher at center. However after storming out to a 4-0 start, the Tigers were defeated by Stan Cofall and the Youngstown Patricians 14-6. However later that season Cofall and Bob Peck decided to play for Massillon which prematurely ended the Pats 1917 campaign. However despite their winning seasons and star talent, Massillon was still losing money. One reason for the disparity is that Massillon was smaller than Canton, meaning it had a smaller fan base to support its football team. The Tigers had highly devoted following, however they weren't enough of them. Also the city lacked a decent ballpark. as a result many of the Tigers' biggest home games were undersold. The only way to make the Tigers profitable was to use Peggy Parratt's old Akron scheme of bringing in just enough high-priced stars to win. Even then, the Tigers would have probably operated at a loss, but one small enough that it could be made up for by the team's backers. However Massillon did upset the Bulldogs in their second game of the season series 6-0, behind two field goals kicked by Cofall. But despite the upset, Canton was regarded as the U.S. champion; Massillon couldn't make a serious claim. The Tigers had lost their first game with the Bulldogs by a larger margin and dropped two other games to lesser opponents. It had not been a good season for Massillon. They lost three games on the field, and their backers dropped $4,700 at the gate. After the season, a "Cleveland critic" chose an all-pro team from among the four major northeastern Ohio teams. The Massillon players listed on the all-pr listing were Bob Nash, Bob Peck, Pike Johnson, Charley Copley, and Stan Cofall. One of the teams Massillon would play (and defeat soundly) in 1917 was the Buffalo All-Stars, who would later join the NFL as the Buffalo All-Americans in 1917.

Carr had two ways of keeping the team afloat for 16 seasons. The first idea came while he was organizing his football team. Carr knew that he needed an attraction to get people to come to the games. This led him to recruit what is considered the most unusual family ever to play professional sports, the Nesser family. Over the years, ten family members played professional football, seven brothers Al, Frank, Fred, John, Phil, Ray and Ted. The final three members were Ted’s son Charlie, a nephew, Ted Hopkins, and a brother-in-law John Schneider. Over the next two decades the Nesser family became the backbone of the Panhandle franchise.

The makeup of the touring squad was described in the earliest communication of 1897 from Mullineux, as a team made of University students from his school Cambridge, as well as Oxford University, and also of international representatives. Two problems faced Mullineux, the first was that the timing of the tour meant that players would need to leave Britain in early May, when the university vacations had not yet begun. The second was that a long tour would preclude many of the best players from participating due to other commitments. Consequently, early lists of probable touring players had few players listed that finally made the tour. In the pool of potential players the following were noted: James Byrne, Cecil Boyd, Viv Huzzey, Zimans, Ernest Fookes, Lindsay Watson, M Elliott, Herbert Dudgeon, James Gowans, James Franks, J H Kipling, R Forest, Lawrence Bulger, Timoins, R O Swartz, C B Marston, W Neeks (or Needs), Dr Rowland, J W Gorman, and James Couper. Among these names were several high-profile players that recruitment attempts failed to secure. Byrne declined due to pressure of business, while Ernest Fookes was awaiting a serious medical operation. The final member to join the team was Scottish international Alf Bucher, after failed approaches were made to recruit fellow Scot James Couper and Welsh wing Viv Huzzey.

It had been noted in the lead up to the Test that the British team was out of condition. The writer Player in the Brisbane Courier, believed that the first Test was Australia's only chance to beat the British team, as he felt that with the British team's condition improving during the tour, they would be impossible to beat. The British team had been dealing with some illness and injury, necessitating the fielding of a team in the Test that was not their first choice, but in the end identical to the team that played New South Wales the previous weekend. Elliot Nicholson, Alec Timms, and Charles Thompson were all listed as playing, but last minute changes were made. While at a swimming bath, Nicholson injured his foot on a protruding nail, and was unable to play. Bucher played in his place. Timms did not recover from an injury received in the match at Goulburn in time to make the field. Adamson, was moved from the halves to the three-quarters to fill his place, and in turn Cookson filled the opening in the halves left by Adamson. Martelli, who had injured his thumb in the match against Goulburn, and had taken the field against New South Wales, but had to retire due to injury, recovered in time to play in place of Thompson. It had been feared on the evening before the match, that Gwyn Nicholls had caught influenza and would be incapacitated, but instead was a severe cold. Rev. Mullineux also took to the field with a cold. The British played field of four players, at three-quarters, and two half-backs, that contrasted with the Australian field of only one half-back, two at five-eighth, and three at three-quarters.	Bucher played in his place.	/m/07k9kkf	Alf_Bucher	0	6	/people/deceased_person,/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete
The British in the next passage of play were successful in bringing the ball back into the Australians 25, and were soon awarded a free kick. The attempt at goal was poor, and the Australians cleared the ball far down field. The British punt attempt to return the ball back to the Australians end was poor and was charged down, and with the Carew and Cookson pressing their attack by kicking the ball along the ground found their way to the British 25, where the ball was put into touch. The Australians lost the ball in one of the following phases, by way of a Bucher intercept, and had to return to their 25 to defend. A penalty was awarded to the English for off-side play but Martelli's kick for goal was again unsuccessful. Francomb followed the goal kick attempt through, and was narrowly beaten to the ball by Row, who forced it in goal.

The peaks surrounding Squaw Valley were used for the alpine skiing events. The ladies' downhill and men's slalom and giant slalom were on KT-22 mountain, while the ladies' slalom and giant slalom were contested on Little Papoose Peak. Squaw Peak was the site of the men's downhill competition. Prior to the Games, concerns persisted that the courses would not meet international standards. To address these concerns, a test event was held in 1959 and the attending delegates from the International Ski Federation (FIS) left assured that the events would comply with FIS rules and specifications. Bleachers were constructed for officials, coaches and spectators, along with broadcast booths for radio and television. Papoose Peak Jumps was located on Little Papoose Peak directly opposite Blyth Memorial Arena. Designed by Heini Klopfer, the hill was innovative in that it had 40, 60, and 80 meter jumps. Tall trees on both sides protected athletes from the wind, and it was situated so that the sun would be at the jumper's back during the competition.

Westerly slopes of the Teufelsberg were already earlier used. In February 1955 a 24 m long (79 ft) ski jump opened, designed by the ski jumper and architect Heini Klopfer. On 4 March 1962 a bigger ski jump opened offering space for 5,000 spectators. After 1969 no more big ski jumps were held and the ski jumps fell into decay and were removed in 1999.

Papoose Peak Jumps was a ski jumping hill located at Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the US state of California. The hill consisted of three jumps, with K-points of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the 1960 Winter Olympics; the 80-meter hill hosted the ski jumping event and the 60-meter hill the Nordic combined event. The jump was designed by Heini Klopfer and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since been demolished and the hillside now features a ski lift.

If I had any information (on him) I would be giving it to you'.

The next season saw Wales complete their first full Home Nations Championship, with Gould playing as the lone centre in all three games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series, was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal, gaving Wales the win over Ireland, which made up for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in the draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played in one of the two Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, the first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship, but returned for the clash with Ireland. On his return Gould was given the captaincy of the Welsh team, and found himself playing alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. It was not the best of starts for Gould's captaincy, losing by two tries to nil at home, but would be the first of 18 caps in which Gould would lead out his country, a record that stood for almost a century.

Williams first came to prominence as a rugby player while representing Cardiff, a team he captained after Charlie Arthur. Williams was first selected for the Welsh national rugby team in a game against Scotland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship. Williams was one of three new Welsh caps chosen for the match, along with half-back George Bowen and full-back Hugh Hughes. The game was a one-sided affair with Scotland scoring 12 tries without reply. Despite the crushing defeat the selectors kept faith with the squad, making few changes. Williams was reselected for the next game of the Championship, played at Birkenhead, which Wales won, mainly thanks to a drop goal from Arthur 'Monkey' Gould.

Arthur came to prominence as a rugby player while playing for first class team Cardiff. His first international cap was in the second game of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, when George Bowen was moved to cover the absent Arthur Gould, and Arthur took Bowen's normal position. Under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, Wales lost the game against Ireland at Lansdowne Road. Despite the loss, Arthur was chosen for the Wales team to face the touring Māoris. Played at St. Helen's on 22 December 1888, the Swansea crowd was very hostile towards their own team. The crowd believed that the Swansea backs had been overlooked and booed the Welsh players from other clubs, Arthur and Newport's George Thomas were picked out for specific ill treatment. Even without the full support of the Welsh crowd, Arthur ended on the winning side with tries from Thomas, Towers and Hannan.

Evans was first selected for Wales in the opening game of the 1887 Home Nations Championship, played in Llanelli against the English team. Evans was partnered with team captain and Newport player Charlie Newman. The Welsh team held England to a nil - nil draw, their best result to that date, and Evans was reselected for the next game of the Championship, away to Scotland. On this occasion, Evans was partnered with new cap George Bowen of Swansea, the Welsh captaincy going to Bob Gould. The match was a humiliation for Wales, with Scotland running in 12 tries without reply. The Welsh selectors reacted with massive restructuring of the back positions, with only Arthur 'Monkey' Gould keeping his place. Bowen and Evans were replaced by John Goulstone Lewis and William Stadden.	On this occasion, Evans was partnered with new cap George Bowen of Swansea, the Welsh captaincy going to Bob Gould.	/m/04jbdfp	George_Bowen_(rugby_player)	51	63	/people/deceased_person,/people/person,/sports/pro_athlete
Lewis, nicknamed "Johnny Bach", played club rugby for first class Welsh team, Llanelli. While playing for Llanelli, Lewis was awarded his one and only international cap, when he was selected to represent Wales against Ireland in the 1887 Home Nations Championship. The game was the third and last in the series, and Wales had drawn against England, but lost to Scotland, so a win over Ireland would give Wales their highest finish in the Championship to date. Wales were also suffering from a lack of continuity in their half-back pairings, with the team not fielding an identical pair of half-backs since 1885. The Ireland game was no exception; the previous match away to Scotland saw the Welsh selectors choose the Cardiff pairing of George Bowen and Jem Evans; but with Bowen moved to threequarters, Lewis was brought in alongside veteran half-back William "Buller" Stadden. Played on the neutral territory of Birkenhead Park, Wales won by a single dropped goal from Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, even though Ireland outscored the Welsh team three tries to one. Despite the win, Lewis found his position taken by Evans the next season, and did not represent Wales again. Despite being out of favour with the Welsh selectors, he was rewarded by his home club during the 1887-88 season when he was made captain of the senior team.

Jones first played rugby for his local school before joining Glynneath. Like many successful players from the area, once Jones had been noticed as a rugby talent, he progressed to Neath RFC, the most notable club in the region. In the 1903-04 season, Neath made Jones the captain of the Neath senior XV. As captain of Neath, Jones was selected for his one and only international appearance, playing for Wales in the country's final game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship. Wales had already played England and Scotland, registering a draw and a win, meaning a win over Ireland would give Wales the possibility of winning the Championship. The Welsh selectors had brought in new capped players throughout the campaign and the final game was no exception. Jones was one of three players who were representing Wales for the first time during the Irish game and the tenth of the tournament. All three new caps were in the forward positions, and Jones was joined by Newport's Charlie Pritchard and Sid Bevan from Swansea. The game ended controversially, with the match referee blames for allowing Ireland a try from an illegal forward pass, and then denying Welsh wing Dick Jones a winning try. Wales finished the 1904 Championship in second and Jones was never selected to play for Wales again.

On 29 October 2012, Lotus F1 team confirmed that Räikkönen would be racing with the team in 2013. The news came after several weeks of speculation that Räikkönen had several other options for 2013 including other forms of motorsport. On 17 March 2013 he won the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix despite starting from seventh, thanks to a two-stop strategy. He also set the fastest lap of the race on lap 56. He described the victory as one of his easiest wins. Räikkönen qualified seventh in Malaysia, but was demoted three places for impeding Nico Rosberg during qualifying. He finished the race seventh, behind team-mate Grosjean, after damaging his car at the start. At the Chinese Grand Prix, he qualified and finished 2nd, despite having to regain the two places he lost at the start and having damaged the front of his car while battling Sergio Pérez for position. In the Bahrain Grand Prix he qualified 9th, but was promoted to 8th after Lewis Hamilton received a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. He finished the race second ahead of his team-mate Romain Grosjean, who started the race from eleventh on the grid, with Sebastian Vettel winning the race. The podium of the race was exactly same as in 2012. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Räikkönen started 4th and finished 2nd thanks to a three-stop strategy. At the next race in Monaco Räikkönen started 5th but an aggressive overtake by Sergio Pérez gave him a puncture and dropped him out of the points until a last ditch attempt on the final lap where he overtook Esteban Gutiérrez, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg to gain 10th place and a single point to add to his streak of 23 consecutive points finishes, one shy of the record of 24 set by Michael Schumacher across three seasons between 2001 and 2003.

Relative to its population, Finland has been a top country in the world in automobile racing, measured by international success. Finland has produced three Formula One World Champions – Keke Rosberg (Williams, 1982), Mika Häkkinen (McLaren, 1998 and 1999) and Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari, 2007). Along with Räikkönen, the other Finnish Formula One driver currently active is Valtteri Bottas (Williams). Rosberg's son, Nico Rosberg (Mercedes), is also currently driving, but under his mother's German nationality. Other notable Finnish Grand Prix drivers include Leo Kinnunen, JJ Lehto and Mika Salo. Finland has also produced most of the world's best rally drivers, including the ex-WRC World Champion drivers Marcus Grönholm, Juha Kankkunen, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Timo Salonen and Ari Vatanen. The only Finn to have won a road racing World Championship, Jarno Saarinen, was killed in 1973 while racing.

Jones was made captain of Pontypool for three consecutive seasons, from 1904 to 1907; and in 1907 he was awarded his one and only international cap. During the first decade of the 20th century, Wales was going through its First Golden Age of Rugby, and the team was filled with talented back players, competition for international caps was fierce. In the 1907 Home Nations Championship, Wales had used both Teddy Morgan and Hopkin Maddock on the left wing, but when neither were available for the final Welsh encounter of the tournament, Jones was brought into the squad. The game was played on 9 March, with Welsh home advantage at the Cardiff Arms Park against Ireland. Jones came into a strong three-quarter, and was partnered opposite Johnnie Williams on the wing, with Pontypool team-mate John Hart Evans and Wales captain Rhys Gabe at centre. The Wales team were convincing winners, beating the Irish 29-0. All the points came from the backs with the three-quarters scoring five tries, three from Williams, one from Gabe, and Jones scored an international try on his debut. Despite such a promising start, Jones was replaced the next season by Reggie Gibbs and never represented Wales again.
